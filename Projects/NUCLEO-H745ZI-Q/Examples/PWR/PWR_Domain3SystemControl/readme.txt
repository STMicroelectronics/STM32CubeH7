@par Example Description 

This example shows how to maintain a basic activity of the system in low power 
mode with D3 Domain only by ensuring the communication between the D3SRAM, the BDMA 
and the LPUART when the system is in Stop mode.

In this example two boards are used to send/receive data by using the LPUART so  
there are two examples to compile one for each board.
To compile the Domain 3 system control in low power mode example: Uncomment 
LOW_POWER_BOARD define in the common.h file.
To compile the LPUART transmit, receive and verify data example: Comment 
LOW_POWER_BOARD define in the common.h file.

First Board:
The first board works in Low Power Mode since the CM7 (D1 Domain), the CM4  
(D2 Domain) and the D3 Domain are in STOP mode. Only D3 Domain will ensure the 
communication between the D3SRAM, the BDMA and the LPUART when a chunk is received.
After a system start-up, LED1 and LED2 are turned ON to indicate that the system
is in RUN mode.
After 3 seconds LED2 will turn OFF to indicate that the CM4 is entered into STOP mode
then after 5 seconds LED1 will turn OFF to indicate that the CM7 is entered into STOP mode.
When the system (CM7 , CM4 and D3 domain) enter STOP mode the user can then start 
LPUART data transmission by using the second board.
After receiving 5 chunks (20 Bytes) only the CM7 will wake up and send back the 
received data to the second board and finally it will re-enter to STOP mode.
LED3 will turn ON in case of error during receiving or transmission process.

Second Board:
The second board works in RUN mode. It is used to transmit chunks of 4 Bytes 
to the first board then receive and verify the received data after sending 
5 chunks.
After a system start-up, the CM4 will enter STOP mode while LED1 is turned ON to 
indicate that the CM7 is in RUN mode.
The user has to press the Tamper button to start LPUART data transmission. 
LED1 will remain toggling while no error occurred during the transmission and 
reception process.
LED3 will turn ON in case of error during the transmission and reception process.

When the test is started by pressing the Tamper button the transmission and
reception process between the two boards is repeated in an infinite loop.

Board: NUCLEO-H745ZI-Q
Tx Pin: PB.06 (pin 14 on CN7 connector)
Rx Pin: PB.07 (pin 16 on CN7 connector)

Two identical boards are connected as shown on the picture above.
Board 1: receiving chunks in low power mode, then transmit them.
Board 2: transmit chunks, then receiving and verifying them.

How to run:
  - Compile the program with LOW_POWER_BOARD define, then load it in the first 
    board (CM7 code : target configuration STM32H745ZI_Nucleo_CM7 and CM4 code target
    configuration STM32H745ZI_Nucleo_CM4).
  - Compile the program without LOW_POWER_BOARD define, then load it in the 
    second board (CM7 code : target configuration STM32H745ZI_Nucleo_CM7 and CM4
     code target configuration STM32H745ZI_Nucleo_CM4).
  - Connect the two boards as shown in the picture above and start them.
  - LED2 in the first board will set ON for 3 seconds, then it will turn Off 
    to indicate that the CM4 core is entered into low power mode.
  - LED1 in the first board will set ON for 5 seconds, then it will turn Off 
    to indicate that the CM7 core is entered into low power mode.
  - LED1 in the second board will maintain set to indicate that the system is in
    RUN mode.
  - When LED1 and LED2 of the first board are turned Off the whole system is in 
    low power modes therefore the user can start the transmission of LPUART data
    by pressing on the Tamper button in the second board.
  => If the test passed, then LED1 on the second board will toggle to indicate 
     that the transmission and reception processs are in progress and no error 
     occurred.
     If an error occurred during the communication LED3 (Red LED) of the second 
     board will turn On.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.

The SystemClock_Config() function is used to set the Flash latency and
to configure the system clock :
  - The Cortex-M7 at 400MHz 
  - The Cortex-M4 at 200MHz.
  - The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI/AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals 
    and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
  - The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1/APB2 peripherals 
    and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 100MHz.
CPU1 (Cortex-M7) and CPU2 (Cortex-M4) are booting at once (with respect to configured boot Flash options)
System Init, System clock, voltage scaling and L1-Cache configuration are done by CPU1 (Cortex-M7).
In the meantime Domain D2 is put in STOP mode (CPU2: Cortex-M4 in deep sleep mode) to save power consumption.
When system initialization is finished, CPU1 (Cortex-M7) could release CPU2 (Cortex-M4) when needed
by means of HSEM notification or by any D2 Domain wakeup source (SEV,EXTI..).

The above will guarantee that CPU2 (Cortex-M4) code execution starts after system initialization :
(system clock config, external memory configuration..).

After Domain D2 wakeup, if  CPU1 attempts to use any resource from such a domain, 
the access will not be safe until “clock ready flag” of such a domain is set (by hardware). 
The check could be done using this macro : __HAL_RCC_GET_FLAG(RCC_FLAG_D2CKRDY).

The D3 low power example uses the BDMA channel 7 configured in peripheral to memory mode with the 
DMAMUX request generator 0 (Lpuart1_it_R_WUP_ASYNC signal).
The BDMA with the DMAMUX request generator are used to generate 4 DMA transfer requests when the LPUART FIFO 
reaches a threshold of 4 Bytes which is the size of a transmitted chunk.

The BDMA channel 7 is configured in peripheral to memory mode to ensure data transfer from the LPUART 
data register to the D3SRAM (@0x38000000). 
After receiving 5 chunks of data, the BDMA transfer complete interrupt is generated and the system
is waking up from Stop mode to send-back the received data if no error occurred.
Finally the system will restart automatically the reception process and re-enter STOP mode again.

The DMAMUX request generator block is configured using function "HAL_DMAEx_ConfigMuxRequestGenerator" 
with the following parameters :
- SignalID      : set to HAL_DMAMUX2_REQ_GEN_LPUART1_RX_WKUP which corresponds to Lpuart1_it_R_WUP_ASYNC signal.
- Polarity      : Set to RISING to use rising edge for DMA requests generation.
- RequestNumber : 4 i.e on each received chunk from the LPUART 4 DMA requests are generated.

The DMA request generator is then enabled using the function “HAL_DMAEx_EnableMuxRequestGenerator”.

The CPU is only used to intercept a DMA transfer error if any and sets the LED3 (Red LED) to ON in this case
or to tramsmit the received data if no error occurred.

@note The BDMA has access to  D3 Domain SRAMs and peripherals only, thus aRxBuffer buffer
      has been placed to the D3SRAM (@0x38000000)
			
@note The low power mode example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M7 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled.

@Note For the Cortex-M7, if the application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex-M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"
      
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32H745xx/STM32H755xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-H745ZI-Q
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - For each target configuration (STM32H745ZI_Nucleo_CM7 and STM32H745ZI_Nucleo_CM4) : 
     - Rebuild all files with LOW_POWER_BOARD compile swicth (in common.h file)
     - Load images into target memory in 1st board.
     - Rebuild all files without LOW_POWER_BOARD swicth (in common.h file)
     - Load images into target memory in 2nd board.
     - Power off/On both boards.
     - wait for LED1 and LED2 to turn Off on 1st board.
     - Press Tamper button on 2nd board --> LED1 should start toggling indicating 
        that transmission and reception processs are in progress.
