@par Application Description

This application is a part of the USB Host Library package using STM32Cube firmware. It describes how to use
USB host application based on the Mass Storage Class (MSC) on the STM32H723XX devices.

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32H723ZGT6 USB OTG Host peripheral to operate with an USB
flash disk using the Bulk Only Transfer (BOT) and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) transparent
commands combined with a file system FatFs (Middleware component).

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H723XX Devices :
The CPU at 520 MHz
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 130MHz.

The High speed OTG IP in full speed mode USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from PLL3.

When the application is started, the connected USB flash disk device is detected in MSC mode and gets
initialized. The STM32 MCU behaves as a MSC Host, it enumerates the device and extracts VID, PID,
manufacturer name, Serial no and product name information and displays it on the UART Hyperterminal.
This application is based on read/write file and explore the USB flash disk content trough a MSC routine.

Debug messages are desplayed along with each new step of the application :
 - "File Operations" operation writes a small text file (less to 1 KB) on the USB flash disk.
 - "Explorer Disk" operation explores the USB flash disk content and displays it on the uart terminal.
    Display the whole USB flash disk content (recursion level 2).

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

For more details about the STM32Cube USB Host library, please refer to UM1720
"STM32Cube USB Host library".


It is possible to fine tune needed USB Host features by modifying defines values in USBH configuration
file “usbh_conf.h” available under the project includes directory, in a way to fit the application
requirements, such as:
- Level of debug: USBH_DEBUG_LEVEL
                  0: No debug messages
                  1: Only User messages are shown
                  2: User and Error messages are shown
                  3: All messages and internal debug messages are shown
   By default debug messages are displayed on the debugger IO terminal; to redirect the Library
   messages to uart terminal, stm32h7xx_hal_uart.c driver needs to be added to the application sources.
   Debug messages are displayed on the uart terminal using ST-Link.


@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32H723XX devices.

  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics stm32h7xx_nucleo
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-H723ZG Set-up
    - Plug the USB key into the NUCLEO-H723ZG board through 'USB micro A-Male
      to A-Female' cable to the connector:
      - CN13 : to use USB High Speed OTG IP in full speed (HS_IN_FS)
    -Connect ST-Link cable to the PC USB port to display data on the HyperTerminal.
    A virtual COM port will then appear in the HyperTerminal:

     - Hyperterminal configuration:
      - Data Length = 8 Bits
      - One Stop Bit
      - No parity
      - BaudRate = 115200 baud
      - Flow control: None

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Open the configured uart hyperterminal in order to display debug messages.
 - Run the application
 - Open the configured uart hyperterminal in order to display debug messages.
@note
   The user has to check the list of the COM ports in Device Manager to find out the number of the
   COM ports that have been assigned (by OS) to the Stlink VCP .
