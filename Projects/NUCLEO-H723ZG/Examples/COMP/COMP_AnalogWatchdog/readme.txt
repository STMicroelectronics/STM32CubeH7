@par Example Description 

How to use a pair of comparator peripherals to compare a voltage level applied on
a GPIO pin to two thresholds: the internal voltage reference (VREFINT) and a fraction
of the internal voltage reference (VREFINT/4), in interrupt mode.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H723xx Devices :
The CPU at 520 MHz.
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 520 MHz/2.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 520 MHz/4.


  - The upper threshold is set to VREFINT (about 1.2V)
  - The lower threshold is set to VREFINT / 4 (about 0.3V)
      NB: For precise value of VREFINT & VREFINT/4, please refer to datasheet.

LED on NUCLEO-H723ZG can be used to monitor the voltage level compared to comparators thresholds:

- Voltage above the upper threshold: wake-up from low-power mode stop, LED2 blinks quickly.
- Voltage under the lower threshold: wake-up from low-power mode stop, LED2 blinks slowly (once every 1s).
- Voltage within the 2 thresholds: MCU enters in low-power mode stop, LED2 is turned off.

@note LED1 is connected to PB0 which is the comparator input pin. 
      when applying a sufficient voltage on PB0 , the LED1 turns ON.

@note For debug, since this example makes the device enter in low-power stop:
      MCU must be woken-up before further download of program. Either set a voltage out of window thresholds
      or download after release of reset button.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides 
      accurate delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. 
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than the 
      peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked. 
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set 
      to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32H723xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-H723ZG board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-H723ZG Set-up
    - Use an external power supply and adjust supply voltage (above, within and below thresholds)
    and connect it on PB.00 (connected on board connector, refer to board user maunual)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
