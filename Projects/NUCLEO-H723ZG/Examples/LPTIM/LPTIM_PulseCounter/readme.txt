@par Example Description

How to configure and use, through the LPTIM HAL API, the LPTIM peripheral
to count pulses.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H723xx Devices :
The CPU at 520 MHz.
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals, D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 520 MHz/2.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 520 MHz/4.

To reduce power consumption, MCU enters stop mode after starting counting. Each
time the counter reaches the maximum value (Period/Autoreload), an interruption
is generated, the MCU is woken up from stop mode and LED1 toggles the last state.

In this example Period value is set to 1000, so each time the counter counts
(1000 + 1) rising edges on LPTIM1_IN1 pin, an interrupt is generated and LED1
toggles.

In this example the internal clock provided to the LPTIM1 is LSI (32 Khz),
so the external input is sampled with LSI clock. In order not to miss any event,
the frequency of the changes on the external Input1 signal should never exceed the
frequency of the internal clock provided to the LPTIM1 (LSI for the
present example).

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.


@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H723xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-H723ZG
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - Generate pulses on PD12 (pin 21 in CN10 connector). (Connect a square waveform).

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
