@par Example Description

This projects provides a reference template that can be used to build any firmware application.

This projects is configured for STM32H7A3xxQ devices using STM32CubeH7 HAL and running on 
NUCLEO-H7A3ZI-Q board from STMicroelectronics.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H7A3xxQ Devices :
The CPU at 280MHz
The HCLK for CD Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , CD Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and SRD Domain AHB4  peripherals at 280MHz.
The APB clock dividers for CD Domain APB3 peripherals, CD Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and SRD Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 140MHz.
 
The template includes also two functions used to configure MPU feature and to enable the CPU Cache,
respectively MPU_Config() and CPU_CACHE_Enable().
These functions are provided as template implementation that User may integrate in his application, 
to enhance the performance in case of use of AXI interface with several masters.

@note Some code parts can be executed in the ITCM-RAM (64 KB) which decreases critical task execution time, compared  
      to code execution from Flash memory. This feature can be activated using '#pragma location = ".itcmram"' to be 
      placed above function declaration, or using the toolchain GUI (file options) to execute a whole source file in
	  the ITCM-RAM.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA (or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : CD AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters (DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case, it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series and STM32H7 Series"

@Note User can choose where to locate the default RAM region as follows:

		- EWARM IDE:
			Go to Project options-->Linker--> Config--> Linker configuration file:
				- For DTCM RAM select: $PROJ_DIR$\stm32h7a3xxq_flash.icf
				- For CD-AXI SRAM select: $PROJ_DIR$\stm32h7a3xxq_flash_rw_sram1.icf

		- MDK-ARM IDE:
			Go to Project options --> Target:
				- For DTCM RAM check IRAM1 and uncheck IRAM2 
				- For CD-AXI SRAM check IRAM2 and uncheck IRAM1

		- Cube IDE:
			Go to Project properties: C/C++ Build-->Settings--> Tools settings --> MCU GCC Linker --> General:
				- For DTCM RAM select: ../STM32H7A3ZITXQ_FLASH.ld
				- For CD-AXI SRAM select: ../STM32H7A3ZITXQ_FLASH_SRAM1.ld
