At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H7A3xxQ Devices :
The CPU at 280MHz
The HCLK for CD Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , CD Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and SRD Domain AHB4  peripherals at 280MHz.
The APB clock dividers for CD Domain APB3 peripherals, CD Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and SRD Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 140MHz.


The PSSI peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_PSSI_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_PSSI_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed PSSI resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
GPIO, DMA and NVIC). You may update this function to change PSSI configuration.


Transmission_Reception Process : (Slave)

  The HAL_PSSI_Transmit_DMA() and the HAL_PSSI_Receive_DMA() ,functions 
  allow respectively the transmission and the reception of a predefined data buffer 
  once the clock is ON in the specidfied Pin (PA6).
  
  1- Transmit the data 
  2- Receive the data
  3- Verify that the received data is compliant to the sent one and modified by the "Master"
  
  
  NUCLEO-H7A3ZI-Q  board's LEDs can be used to monitor the Transfer status:
  LED1 is On to indicate that the Transmission_Reception process is finished correctly.
  LED2 is On when Transmit is done and receive is ongoing 
  LED3 is On there are errors while transmiting /receiving data or the received data is false.
  
  
Master Simulation Process :
  
  We choose :
  The TIM1 that will generate the clock to allow the slave to transmit and recieve data 
  The PSSI as an IP that will in infinite loop :
   1- Receive the data from the PSSI_Slave wich is "Hello from Slave"
   2- Verify that is a request from a Slave
   3- Modify it by adding ": received, from Master" 
   4- Transmit "Hello from Slave: received, from Master"

  NUCLEO-H7A3ZI-Q  board's LEDs can be used to monitor the Transfer status:
  LED1 is On for 1s to indicate that the Reception_Transmission process is finished correctly.
  LED2 is On when receive is ongoing 
  LED3 is On there are errors while receiving/transmiting data.
 
 
The user can choose between Master and Slave through "#define MASTER_BOARD"
in the "main.c" file:
If the Master board is used, the "#define MASTER_BOARD" must be uncommented.
If the Slave board is used the "#define MASTER_BOARD" must be commented.

@note Some code parts can be executed in the ITCM-RAM (64 KB) which decreases critical task execution time, compared  
      to code execution from Flash memory. This feature can be activated using '#pragma location = ".itcmram"' to be 
      placed above function declaration, or using the toolchain GUI (file options) to execute a whole source file in
	  the ITCM-RAM.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA (or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : CD AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
              In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
              Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
              Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
              Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series and STM32H7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32H7A3xxQ devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-H7A3ZI-Q 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-H7A3ZI-Q Set-up
    - Connect PSSI Data lines ,clock line and Data Enable line of Master board to PSSI lines of Slave Board (described previously).
    - Connect PSSI clock line of Master board to TIM_PWM Pin of the same board (described previously).
    - Connect GND of Master board to GND of Slave Board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
    o Uncomment "#define MASTER_BOARD" and load the project in Master Board
    o Comment   "#define MASTER_BOARD" and load the project in Slave Board
 - Run the example
