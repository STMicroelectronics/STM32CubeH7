@par Example Description 

How to configure and use, through the HAL LPTIM API, the LPTIM peripheral using LSE 
as counter clock, to generate a PWM signal, in a low-power mode.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H7A3xxQ Devices :
The CPU at 280 MHz.
The HCLK for CD Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals, CD Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and SRD Domain AHB4 peripherals at 280 MHz.
The APB clock dividers for CD Domain APB3 peripherals, CD Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and SRD Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 280 MHz/2.

In this example, the LPTIM instance used is LPTIM1 and the low power mode is Stop mode.



The counter clock is LSE (32.768 KHz), Autoreload equal to 99 so the output
frequency (FrequencyOutput) will be equal to 327.680.

  FrequencyOutput = Counter Clock Frequency / (Autoreload + 1)
                  = 32768 / 100
                  = 327.680 Hz

Pulse value equal to 49 and the duty cycle (DutyCycle) is computed as follow:

  DutyCycle = 1 - ((PulseValue + 1)/ (Autoreload + 1))
  DutyCycle = 50%

To minimize the power consumption, after starting generating the PWM signal,
the MCU enters in Stop mode. Note that GPIOs are configured in Low Speed to
enhance the consumption. 

User push-button pin (PC.13)is configured as input with external interrupt (EXTI15_10),
falling edge. When User push-button is pressed, wakeup event is generated and PWM signal
generation is stopped.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and theÂ MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA (or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : CD AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters (DMAs, DMA2D, LTDC, MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
              Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
              Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series and STM32H7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H7A3xxQ devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics Nucleo-H7A3ZI-Q
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.      

  - Connect PD.13 (pin 19 in CN10 connector) to an oscilloscope to monitor the LPTIM1 output waveform.
  
  - LSE oscillator must be mounted on the board, else this example does not work.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
