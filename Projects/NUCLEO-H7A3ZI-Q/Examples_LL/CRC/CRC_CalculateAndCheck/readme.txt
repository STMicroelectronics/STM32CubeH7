@par Example Description

How to configure the CRC calculation unit to compute a CRC code for a given data
buffer, based on a fixed generator polynomial (default value 0x4C11DB7). The
peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary service functions for
optimization purposes (performance and size).

At the beginning of the main program the SystemClock_Config() function is called to configure the system clock for STM32H7A3xxQ Devices :
The CPU at 280 MHz.
The HCLK for CD Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals, CD Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and SRD Domain AHB4 peripherals at 280 MHz.
The APB clock dividers for CD Domain APB3 peripherals, CD Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and SRD Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 280 MHz/2.

The CRC peripheral is configured to work with default polynomial value (32-bit long).
Normal representation of this polynomial value is :
 X^32 + X^26 + X^23 + X^22 + X^16 + X^12 + X^11 + X^10 +X^8 + X^7 + X^5 + X^4 + X^2 + X + 1.
Generated CRC value is then 32 bits long.

Example execution:
After startup from reset and system configuration, CRC configuration is performed (use of default Polynomial and initialisation values).
CRC code of a given data buffer is computed. 
Data buffer length has been chosen as not an exact nb of u32 (32-bit words), in order to illustrate 
use of offered API for feeding the calculator (u32, u16 or u8 inputs).
The calculated CRC code is stored in uwCRCValue variable.
Once calculated, CRC value (uwCRCValue) is compared to the CRC expected value (uwExpectedCRCValue),
and if both are equal, LED1 is turned On. 
In case of errors, LED1 is blinking (1sec period).


@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : CD AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters (DMAs, DMA2D, LTDC, MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
              Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
              Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series and STM32H7 Series"
