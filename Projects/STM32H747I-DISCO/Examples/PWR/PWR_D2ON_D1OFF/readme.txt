@par Example Description 

This example shows how to run the system with only D2 domain in Run mode 
while D1 domain is in Standby mode.

The SystemClock_Config() function is used to set the Flash latency and  to 
configure the system clock :
  - The Cortex-M7 at 400MHz 
  - The Cortex-M4 at 200MHz.
  - The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI/AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals 
    and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
  - The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1/APB2  
    peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 100MHz.

In this example CM4 boot option should be deactivated by using ST LINK Utility to
guarantee that CM4 will not boot automatically.
To deactivate CM4 boot go to STLINK_Utility->Target->Option_Bytes then deselect
BOOT CM4 from the "User configuration option byte" menu.

After compiling CM4 target the user is aimed to copy the STM32H747I_CM4.bin file 
exist under PWR_D2ON_D1OFF\EWARM\STM32H747I_DISCO_CM4\Exe\STM32H747I_CM4.bin
in the Flash memory at 0x08080000 address by using the STLINK_Utility.
To do this go to STLINK_Utility->Target->Program then set the start address at 
0x08080000 and finaly click Start button.

After a system RESET or a CM7 core debugging the following steps will be done:
  - HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals, initialize the 
    Flash interface and the systick.
  - SystemClock_Config() function is called to configure the system clock.
  - memcpy function is called to copy the CM4 code from Flash to D2SRAM memory.
  - HAL_SYSCFG_CM4BootAddConfig function is called to configure the CM4 boot address at 
    0x10000000 (here CM4 will boot from D2SRAM memory when it is released by CM7).
  - HAL_RCCEx_EnableBootCore function is called to release and start CM4 boot process.
  - HAL_PWREx_EnterSTANDBYMode function is called to enter D1 domain to STANDBY mode.
  
When HAL_RCCEx_EnableBootCore function is called by CM7 core, the CM4 core will
be released and start booting from 0x10000000 address therefore it will execute  
it is code copied before by CM7 from Flash to D2SRAM memory. 
The CM4 core will then check if D1 is OFF by using __HAL_RCC_GET_FLAG(RCC_FLAG_D1CKRDY) 
macro therefore if D1 is OFF then LED2 will toggle each 100 ms to indicate test
passed and if D1 is in RUN mode the LED3 will set ON to indicate test failed.
            
Three LEDs are used in this example:
  - LED1: Set ON by CM7 core if a configuration error occurred or if D1 domain
          did not enter STANDBY mode.
  - LED2: Toggle by CM4 core each 100 ms if D1 domain is in Standby mode (test passed).
  - LED3: Set ON by CM4 core if D1 domain is in RUN mode (test failed).

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact that 
      the Cortex-M7 and Cortex-M4 cores are no longer clocked during 
      low power mode so debugging features are disabled.

@note Care must be taken when HAL_RCCEx_PeriphCLKConfig() is used to select 
      the RTC clock source; in this case the Backup domain will be reset in  
      order to modify the RTC Clock source, as consequence RTC registers (including 
      the backup registers) and RCC_CSR register are set to their reset values.

@Note For the Cortex-M7, if the application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex-M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

  - This example has been tested with STM32H747I-DISCO board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - deactivate CM4 boot : go to STLINK_Utility->Target->Option_Bytes then unselect
   BOOT CM4 from the "User configuration option byte" menu.
   
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - For CM4 target configuration (STM32H747I_DISCO_CM4)
     - Rebuild all files.
     - Load the STM32H747I_DISCO_CM4.bin generated file to the Flash memory at 0x08080000 address 
       using the STM32CubeProgrammer.
       Go to Erasing and Programming menu then set the start address at 
       0x08080000, select the file path for STM32H747I_DISCO_CM4.bin generated file and finaly click Start Programming button.

  - For CM7 target configuration (STM32H747I_DISCO_CM7) : 
     - Rebuild all files 
     - Load image into target memory
 - Run the example
