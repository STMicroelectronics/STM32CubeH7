@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to configure the DMA2D peripheral in 
Memory_to_Memory transfer mode.
The example transfers with DMA2D an internal SRAM static texture array aBufferInput[] of size 16x32 
and format ARGB4444 (16 bpp) to destination buffer in internal SRAM in array aBufferResult[].
The number of bytes transferred is then 16x32x2=1024 bytes.

The SystemClock_Config() function is used to set the Flash latency and  to configure the system clock :
  - The Cortex-M7 at 400MHz 
  - Cortex-M4 at 200MHz.
  - The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI/AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals 
    and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
  - The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1/APB2 peripherals 
    and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 100MHz.

CPU1 (Cortex-M7) and CPU2 (Cortex-M4) are booting at once (with respect to configured boot Flash options)
System Init, System clock, voltage scaling and L1-Cache configuration are done by CPU1 (Cortex-M7).
In the meantime Domain D2 is put in STOP mode (CPU2: Cortex-M4 in deep sleep mode) to save power consumption.
When system initialization is finished, CPU1 (Cortex-M7) could release CPU2 (Cortex-M4) when needed
by means of HSEM notification or by any D2 Domain wakeup source (SEV,EXTI..).

The above will guarantee that CPU2 (Cortex-M4) code execution starts after system initialization :
(system clock config, external memory configuration..).

After Domain D2 wakeup, if  CPU1 attempts to use any resource from such a domain, 
the access will not be safe until “clock ready flag” of such a domain is set (by hardware). 
The check could be done using this macro : __HAL_RCC_GET_FLAG(RCC_FLAG_D2CKRDY).

In this basic example the goal is to explain the different fields of the DMA2D 
structure in the case of Memory_to_Memory transfer mode.

After DMA2D configuration, the data transfer is performed and then the transferred 
data are checked byte per byte in comparing the source and destination buffers aBufferInput[] and aBufferResult[].   

STM32H747I-DISCO board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED4 is ON when the DMA2D transfer is complete and when the data are correctly transferred.
 - LED3 is ON when there is a DMA2D transfer error or when data are not correctly transferred
          or when there is an error in DMA2D transfer/Init process.
 If everything all right, at the end of the test, LED4  must be ON, LED3 must be OFF.

@note On the STM32H747xx the ITCM and DTCM RAM are only accessible by the Cortex M7 and the MDMA.
      The ITCM and DTCM RAM are not accessible by the DMA2D thus the source and destination buffer
      should not be located in these RAMs. 
      In this example the RAM area is configured (at the IDE linker file) to the D1 AXI-SRAM  (@0x24000000) 
      which is accessible by the DMA2D. The source buffer of the DMA2D is then located in the internal FLASH 
      and the destination buffer is located in the RAM area which is configured to the D1 AXI-SRAM. 
	  
@note CPU Data Cache maintenance :
      It is recommended to clean the CPU Data cache before starting the  DMA2D transfer. 
      As the source buffer may be prepared by the CPU, this guarantees that the source buffer 
      (if located in the D1 AXI-SRAM which is cacheable) will be up to date before starting the transfer.

      It is recommended to invalidate the CPU Data cache after the DMA2D transfer. 
      As the destination buffer may be used by the CPU, this guarantees Up-to-date data when CPU access 
      to the destination buffer located in the D1 AXI-SRAM (which is cacheable).

@Note For the Cortex-M7, if the application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex-M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"	 
 
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H747xx/STM32H757xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32H747I-DISCO board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.      

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - For each target configuration (STM32H747I_DISCO_CM7 and STM32H747I_DISCO_CM4) : 
     - Rebuild all files 
     - Load images into target memory
 - After loading the two images, you have to reset the board in order to boot (Cortex-M7) and CPU2 (Cortex-M4) at once.
 - Run the example
