@par Example Description

This example shows how to enter the system in STOP/STANDBY mode and wake-up from this
mode using external RESET or WKUP pin connected to the User Button.

This projects is configured for STM32H750xx devices using STM32CubeH7 HAL and running on
STM32H750B-DISCO board from STMicroelectronics.

In this example, the code is executed from QSPI external memory while data are in internal
SRAM memory.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H750xx Devices :
 - The CPU at 400MHz
 - The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals
   and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
 - The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals
   and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz

The SysTick is programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms.

After a reset (or wake-up from STOP/STANDBY mode), LED1 is ON and MCU is in RUN mode.
The system enters STANDBY mode after 3s, LED1 is OFF.
A rising edge on User Button PC.13 will wake-up the system from STOP/STANDBY.
Alternatively, an external RESET of the board will lead to a system wake-up as well.
If the SYSTEM_STOP flag is defined :
The system will enter in STOP mode. After wake up LED1 is ON and MCU is in RUN mode.
If the SYSTEM_STANDBY flag is defined :
The system will enter in STANDBY mode. After wake up, the LED1 is ON during 3s to indicate
the system was resumed from STANDBY mode. These steps are repeated in an infinite loop.

LED2 ON: configuration failed (system will go to an infinite loop)

@note This example use clock provide by STLink (HSE bypass mode).
In order to reduce the power consumption SB13 and SB112 must be opened.
As consequence the example clock source must be changed to internal HSI :
  -  in SystemClock_Config :
       - Change RCC_OscInitStruct.OscillatorType to RCC_OSCILLATORTYPE_HSI
       - Change RCC_OscInitStruct.HSIState to RCC_HSI_ON
       - Change the RCC_OscInitStruct.PLL.PLLSource to RCC_PLLSOURCE_HSI
       - Change RCC_OscInitStruct.PLL.PLLM to 32


@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact
      that the Cortex-M7 core is no longer clocked during low power mode
      so debugging features are disabled.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H750xx devices

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32H750B-DISCO
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

  1. Select required configuration in memory.h in Templates\ExtMem_Boot\Inc.
     The default configuration is the right one: 
     - DATA_AREA set to USE_INTERNAL_SRAM
     - CODE_AREA set to USE_QSPI
  2. Program the internal Flash with the ExtMem_Boot (see below).
  3. Program the external memory with this example(see below).
  4. Start debugging the example or reset for free running.

In order to load the ExtMem_Boot code :
   - Open your preferred toolchain :
      - Open the Project
      - Rebuild all files
      - Load project image

In order to load this example to the external memory:
   - Open your preferred toolchain
      - Open the Project
      - Use project matching ExtMem_Boot selected configuration
      - Rebuild all files:
      - Run & debug the program :
      - For an XiP configuration (eXecute in Place from QSPI):
          - Using EWARM or MDK-ARM : Load project image from the IDE: Project->Debug
          - Using SW4STM32 :
            - Open the STM32CubeProgrammer tool
            - Select the QSPI external flash loader "MT25TL01G_STM32H750B-DISCO" in case of XiP from QSPI
            - From Erasing & Programming menu, browse and open the output binary file relative to your example
            - Load the file into the external QSPI flash using "Start Programming" at the address APPLICATION_ADDRESS (0x90000000)
