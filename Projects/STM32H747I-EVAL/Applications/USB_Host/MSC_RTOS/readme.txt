@par Application Description

This application is a part of the USB Host Library package using STM32Cube firmware. It describes how to use
USB host application based on the Mass Storage Class (MSC) on the STM32H7x devices.

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32H7x USB OTG Host peripheral to operate with an USB
flash disk using the Bulk Only Transfer (BOT) and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) transparent
commands combined with a file system FatFs (Middleware component).

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to set the Flash latency and  to configure the system clock :
  - The Cortex-M7 at 400MHz
  - Cortex-M4 at 200MHz.
  - The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI/AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals
    and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
  - The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1/APB2 peripherals
    and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 100MHz.

CPU1 (Cortex-M7) and CPU2 (Cortex-M4) are booting at once (with respect to configured boot Flash options)

System Init, System clock, voltage scaling and L1-Cache configuration are done by CPU1 (Cortex-M7).
In the meantime Domain D2 is put in STOP mode (CPU2: Cortex-M4 in deep sleep mode) to save power consumption.
When system initialization is finished, CPU1 (Cortex-M7) could release CPU2 (Cortex-M4) when needed
by means of HSEM notification or by any D2 Domain wakeup source (SEV,EXTI..).

The above will guarantee that CPU2 (Cortex-M4) code execution starts after system initialization :
(system clock config, external memory configuration..).

After Domain D2 wakeup, if  CPU1 attempts to use any resource from such a domain,
the access will not be safe until “clock ready flag” of such a domain is set (by hardware).
The check could be done using this macro : __HAL_RCC_GET_FLAG(RCC_FLAG_D2CKRDY).

The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from PLL3.
In the High Speed (HS) mode the USB clock (60 MHz) is driven by the ULPI.

When the application is started, the connected USB flash disk device is detected in MSC mode and gets
initialized. The STM32 MCU behaves as a MSC Host, it enumerates the device and extracts VID, PID,
manufacturer name, Serial no and product name information and displays it on the LCD screen.
This application is based on read/write file and explore the USB flash disk content trough a MSC routine.

A menu is displayed and the user can select any operation from the menu using the Joystick buttons:
 - "File Operations" operation writes a small text file (less to 1 KB) on the USB flash disk.
 - "Explorer Disk" operation explores the USB flash disk content and displays it on the LCD screen.
    User has to press the Key button to display the whole USB flash disk content (recursion level 2).
 - "Re-Enumerate" operation performs a new Enumeration of the device.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set according to the OS resources memory
requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.

For more details about the STM32Cube USB Host library, please refer to UM1720
"STM32Cube USB Host library".


@par USB Library Configuration

To select the appropriate USB Core to work with, user must add the following macro defines within the
compiler preprocessor (already done in the preconfigured projects provided with this application):
      - "USE_USB_HS" when using USB High Speed (HS) Core
      - "USE_USB_FS" when using USB Full Speed (FS) Core

It is possible to fine tune needed USB Host features by modifying defines values in USBH configuration
file “usbh_conf.h” available under the project includes directory, in a way to fit the application
requirements, such as:
- Level of debug: USBH_DEBUG_LEVEL
                  0: No debug messages
                  1: Only User messages are shown
                  2: User and Error messages are shown
                  3: All messages and internal debug messages are shown
   By default debug messages are displayed on the debugger IO terminal; to redirect the Library
   messages on the LCD screen, lcd_log.c driver need to be added to the application sources.

@Note Since this is an RTOS based application, built around FreeRTOS and CMSIS-OS wrapping layer common APIs,
      the RTOS is enabled by setting, #define USBH_USE_OS      1

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"
