@par Demo Description

The STM32Cube demonstration platform comes on top of the STM32Cube(TM) as a firmware
package that offers a full set of software components based on a modular architecture.
All modules can be reused separately in standalone applications.
All these modules are managed by the STM32Cube demonstration kernel that allows to
dynamically add new modules and access common resources (storage, graphical
components and widgets, memory management, real-time operating system).
The STM32Cube demonstration platform is built around the FreeRTOS real-time operating
system and offers a large scope of use cases based on the STM32Cube HAL BSP and several
middleware components.

The demonstration's executables STM32Cube_Demo-STM32H747I-EVAL-VX.Y.Z.hex can be flashed 
to the target using the STM32CubeProgrammer.


Multimedia content is also available in the Storage(SDCard) folder within the demonstration 
package and is to be copied on mass storage using the host PC. Below is the listing of these 
additional files.

Firmware files:
  STEW_firmware.bin            STemWin Binary firmware for MB1166 LCD
  STEW_resources.bin           STemWin Binary resources for MB1166 LCD
  TGFX_firmware.bin            Touch GFX Binary firmware for MB1166 LCD
  TGFX_resources.bin           Touch GFX Binary resources for MB1166 LCD
  EWIZ_firmware.bin            Embedded Wizard Binary firmware for MB1166 LCD
  EWIZ_resources.bin           Embedded Wizard Binary resources for MB1166 LCD

After connection of the LCD on the board, either the MB1315 or the MB1166,
the demonstration starts by displaying an animation with the ST logo and goes
into the Menu Launcher screen where the user can select between three demonstrations,
that's one demonstration per graphics stack: STemWin, TouchGFX and Embedded Wizard.
When a Sub-Demo is selected, the Menu Launcher will check if the firmware and resources
are already existing in both internal and external flashes then if exist it will jump
to the selected Sub-Demo otherwise a pop-up message is displayed requesting a confirmation
to load the suitable firmware and resources. After confirmation the MenuLauncher starts
loading the firmware and resources binaries into receptively the internal flash and the
quadspi memories, a progress bar is shown to follow the loading progress.

Once loading is terminated, the binary Sub-Demo is started.

@note: each Sub-Demo has to load its firmware and resources separately if not already done.
@note: depending on the Sub-Demo, resource loading may take several minutes.


STM32H747I-EVAL
===================

the launcher the user can either select a demonstration to run or display the
info about the system.


Info
=====
In the launcher main screen, the user can press the "i" icon to show or hide
the system info window. The info contains:
- MCU: 		 STM32H7x7 Dual Core
- Board: 	 STM32H7x7I-EVAL
- CPU Speed: CM7 400 MHz, CM4 200 MHz
- Firm. Ver: V1.4.0


STemWin
=======

The STemWin demonstration offers the following modules:

  - Audio player
  - Video Player
  - Clock & Weather
  - Graphical Effect
  - Rocket Game
  - Dual Core
  - System info

 ++ Audio Player
 ---------------
 The audio player module provides a complete audio solution based on the
 STM32H7xxx and delivers a high-quality music experience. It supports playing
 music in WAV format but may be extended to support other compressed
 formats such as MP3 and WMA audio formats.
 
 ++ Video Player
 ---------------
 The video player module provides a video solution based on the STM32H7xxx
 and the STemWin movie APIs. It supports the playing movie in AVI format.
 
 Only the AVI files format with 800x480 pixels as resolution are supported.
 
 ++ Clock & Weather
 ------------------
 The clock & Weather module allows to show and adjust the time and date by
 changing the real time configuration (RTC).

 ++ Graphical Effect
 -------------------
 The Graphic effect module demonstrates the platform’s computing capabilities
 to render a real-time effect at full screen resolution.
 • The implemented filters are
  - Edge detection filter
  - Smoothing filter
  - Sharping filter
  - Raising filter
  - Motion blur filter
 The CPU load metrics are displayed on the middle of top screen. 
 
 ++ Rocket Game
 --------------
 The Rocket Game shows the graphic performance of the Chrom-ART.
 Control the Rocket by moving it on the screen. The player has to collect
 the maximum number of coins to get the best score.
 For demonstration not touching the rocket will lead to a game that is not ending.
 The CPU load metrics are displayed on the middle of top screen. 
 
 ++ Dual Core
 --------------
 The dual core module shows the difference between using dual core and single core.
 when dual core is activated, the fractal video works on CM4 and the rest of the 
 videos runs on CM7, and when dual core deactivated , all videos works on CM7.
 When the dual core activated, the fps will be higher and CPU load will be lower 
 than with a single core.

 The Corext-M4 binary file required for this sub-module is available under \Demonstrations\extra_modules\ST. 
 
 + System Info
 --------------
