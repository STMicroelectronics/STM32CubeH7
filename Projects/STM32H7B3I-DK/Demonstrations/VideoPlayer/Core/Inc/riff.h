To read any RIFF files.
Not specialized to specific types like AVI or WAV.
Special chunks (e.g. "LIST") can contain a nested sub list of chunks


Example structure of RIFF file:

chunk list start ("RIFF") - ID,size,type
  type (of parent chunk header)
  chunk block - list level 0
  chunk block ("LIST") - level 0 - ID,size,type
    type (of parent chunk header)
    chunk block - level 1
    chunk block - level 1
  chunk block - level 0


Usage:
Use a default open-function (file, mem) or create your own
  The required function pointers for reading and seeking are set here
  When creating your own open-function, take a look at the default function code as template
After the file is opened we are in the first chunk at list level 0
 You can freely read and seek within the data of the current junk
 Use riff_nextChunk() to go to the first data byte of the next junk (chunk header is read already then)
If the current junk contains a list of sub level chunks:
 Call riff_seekLevelSub() to be positioned at the first data byte of the first chunk in the sub list level
 Call riff_levelParent() to leave the sub list without changing the file position
Read members of the riff_handle to get all info about current file position, current chunk, etc.

May not work for RIFF files larger than 2GB.
