@par Application Description

How to use LTDC layers display pictures saved under SD card on LCD.

This projects is configured for STM32H7B3xxQ devices using STM32CubeH7 HAL and running on
STM32H7B3I-DISCO board from STMicroelectronics.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H7B3xxQ Devices :
The CPU at 280MHz
The HCLK for CD Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , CD Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and SRD Domain AHB4  peripherals at 280MHz.
The APB clock dividers for CD Domain APB3 peripherals, CD Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and SRD Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 140MHz.

Prior to starting the application, the user has to create a "/Media" directory under the micro SD card root and
copy the pictures stored in PC directory "/Utilities/Media/Pictures".


@note : The user can add pictures of his choice but the file type, resolution
        and pixel format described below must be respected.
        file type    : *.bmp
        resolution   : up to 640x272
        pixel format : RGB565, RGB888 or ARGB8888
		
  Once the LCD, SD card and file systems initialized and configured,
  a content check of the "Media" directory is done and the number of ".BMP" files
  is retained.

  LED3 toggles in a forever loop when the uSD disk I/O driver is not Linked correctly.

@note : An associate LCD driver is used in this application

@note : The maximum number of BMP files is fixed to 25. It can be raised
        until reaching the maximum of SD card memory space.

  The following steps are performed to display all the images stored in the
  SD Card :

  Step1 :
  ------
  The foreground layer is set, the image copied from SD card to intermediate
  SDRAM memory and then copied to LCD frame buffer. The image is fully visible when
  the level of transparency is increased until it becomes totally opaque (reaches 255).

  Step2 :
  ------
  The transparency of the foreground layer
  begins to decrease until becoming totally transparent and the background layer
  is set, the image copied from SD card to intermediate SDRAM memory and then
  copied to LCD frame buffer and finally the level of transparency of the
  background layer increases until it reaches 255 (totally opaque).

  Step3 :
  ------
  The transparency of the background layer
  begins to decrease until becoming totally transparent and return to step1.
  => A delay of 10 ms is inserted between the three steps.

@note
  => If the "Media" directory is empty, a warning message is displayed on
     the LCD : "  No Bitmap files...  "

  => If the file type stored in the "Media" directory is not supported,
     a warning message is displayed on the LCD : "  No Bitmap files...  "

  => If the SD card is removed while running the application, no warning message
     is displayed on the LCD. A reset is needed.

  => If no SD card is dtected, a warning message is displayed on the
     LCD : "  No Bitmap files...  ".

@note Some code parts can be executed in the ITCM-RAM (64 KB) which decrease critical task execution time, compared
      to code execution from Flash memory. This feature can be activated using '#pragma location = ".itcmram"' to be
      placed above function declaration, or using the toolchain GUI (file options) to execute a whole source file in
      the ITCM-RAM.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : CD AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters (DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case, it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series and STM32H7 Series"
