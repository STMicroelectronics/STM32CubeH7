@par Application Description

How to display an animated picture on LCD saved under microSD.

This projects is configured for STM32H7B3xxQ devices using STM32CubeH7 HAL and running on
STM32H7B3I-DISCO board from STMicroelectronics.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H7B3xxQ Devices :
The CPU at 280MHz
The HCLK for CD Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , CD Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and SRD Domain AHB4  peripherals at 280MHz.
The APB clock dividers for CD Domain APB3 peripherals, CD Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and SRD Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 140MHz.

The animated picture is the display of an images sequence with a determined
frequency to be seen like a animated image.

The user has to copy the two directories "BACK" and "TOP" available under
"/Utilities/Media/Pictures/Animated" to the micro SD card root.

* Background picture display
----------------------------
At the beginning, the program checks the existence of an SD card. If the SD card
is not inserted, a warning message is displayed on the LCD :" Please insert SD Card and reset the board "

Once the LCD, SD card and file system initialized and configured, a check
of the existence and the content of the "/BACK" directory is done.

* Foreground animated pictures display
-------------------------------------
A content check of the "/TOP" directory is done and the number of ".BMP" files
is retained.

@note : The maximum number of BMP files is fixed at 25. It can be raised
        until reaching the maximum of SD card memory space.


The following steps are performed to scroll all the images stored in the SD Card :

  - The foreground layer is set, the image copied from SD card (from "/TOP" directory)
    to intermediate SDRAM memory space and then copied to LCD frame buffer.

  - The color keying feature is applied to remove the bottom of foreground layer (transparent)
    and then replaced by the background layer.

  - Jump to next image

@note :
  => If the "/Foreground" directory is empty, a warning message is displayed on the LCD :
     "  No Bitmap files...  "

  => If the file type stored in the "/BACK" or "/TOP" directories is not supported,
     a warning message is displayed on the LCD : " file type not supported. "

  => If the SD card is removed while running the application, A reset is needed.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.


- LED3 toggles in a forever loop when the uSD disk I/O driver is not Linked correctly.


@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : CD AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters (DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case, it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series and STM32H7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H7B3xxQ devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32H7B3I-DISCO
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - The two directories "BACK" and "TOP" under "/Utilities/Media/Pictures/Animated"
   folder must be copied at the micro SD card root.
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
