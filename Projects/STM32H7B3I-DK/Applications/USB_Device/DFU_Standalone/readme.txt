@par Application Description

Compliant implementation of the Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU)
capability to program the embedded Flash memory through the USB peripheral.


At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 280 MHz.
The High Speed (HS) USB module uses
internally a 60-MHz clock.
The DFU transactions are based on Endpoint 0 (control endpoint) transfer. All requests and status
control are sent/received through this endpoint.

The Internal flash memory is split as follows:
 - DFU area located in [0x08000000 : USBD_DFU_APP_DEFAULT_ADD-1]: Only read access
 - Application area located in [USBD_DFU_APP_DEFAULT_ADD : Device's end address]: Read, Write, and Erase
   access

In this application, two operating modes are available:
 1. DFU operating mode:
    This mode is entered after an MCU reset in case:
     - The DFU mode is forced by the user: the user presses the TAMP button.
     - No valid code found in the application area: a code is considered valid if the MSB of the initial
       Main Stack Pointer (MSP) value located in the first address of the application area is equal to
       0xC000

 2. Run-time application mode:
    This is the normal run-time activities. This is the normal run-time activities. A binary which toggles LEDs on the STM32H7B3I-DISCO board is provided in Binary directory.

@note After each device reset (unplug the STM32H7B3I-DK board from PC), Plug the STM32H7B3I-DK board with Key User Button button
pressed to enter the DFU mode.

Traditionally, firmware is stored in Hex, S19 or Binary files, but these formats do not contain the
necessary information to perform the upgrade operation, they contain only the actual data of the program
to be downloaded. However, the DFU operation requires more information, such as the product identifier,
vendor identifier, Firmware version and the Alternate setting number (Target ID) of the target to be
used, this information makes the upgrade targeted and more secure. To add this information, DFU file
format is used. For more details refer to the "DfuSe File Format Specification" document (UM0391).

To generate a DFU image, download "DFUse Demonstration" tool and use DFU File Manager to convert a
binary image into a DFU image. This tool is for download from www.st.com
To download a *.dfu image, use "DfuSe Demo" available within "DFUse Demonstration" install directory.
To download a *.bin or *.hex image, use "STM32CubeProgrammer" available from ST web site.

Please refer to UM0412, DFuSe USB device firmware upgrade STMicroelectronics extension for more details
on the driver installation and PC host user interface.

@note A binary which toggles LEDs on the STM32H7B3I-DK board is provided in Binary directory.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL configuration.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The build-in USB peripheral of the stm32h7xx does not provide a specific interrupt for USB cable plug/unplug
      detection. The correct way to detect the USB cable plug/unplug is to detect the availability of the VBUS line
      using a normal GPIO pin (external interrupt line).


@par USB Library Configuration

It is possible to fine tune needed USB Device features by modifying defines values in USBD configuration
file “usbd_conf.h” available under the project includes directory, in a way to fit the application
requirements, such as:
 - USBD_DFU_APP_DEFAULT_ADD, specifying the address from where user's application will be downloaded.

Device's end address is the end address of the flash memory and it is dependent on the device in use.
