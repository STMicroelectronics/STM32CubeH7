@par Example Description

How to configure the DMA2D peripheral for memory-to-memory operation with
blending transfer and alpha inversion modes.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 280 MHz.

The LCD is initialized using the BSP functions. the LCD layer 0 is configured for display
with color format set to ARGB8888.
  
In this transfer mode two input sources are fetched : foreground and background.
In this example, the foreground and background are configured as following :
  - Foreground object 
  - input memory address at FLASH memory (static image arrays coded in FLASH).
  - Format : RGB565
  - Size   : 240x130
  - Background object 
  - input memory address at FLASH memory (static image arrays coded in FLASH).
  - Format : RGB565
  - Size   : 240x130
  - The constant alpha for foreground is decreased to see the background.
  - The alpha mode for foreground and background is configured to see two 
    superposed images in the resulting image out of the ChromArt DMA2D operation.
   - The Foreground alpha inversion is set sequentially to regular then inverted to demonstrate
     this new DMA2D feature capability.
        
The DMA2D blends the two sources pixels buffers stored into the FLASH to compute 
the resulting pixel in the LCD display frame buffer. 
The DMA2D destination address and output offset are calculated in such a way 
to place the output blended image to the center of the LCD.
The transferred data to the output memory address is the result of the blending operation 
between background and foreground (with Foreground alpha inversion set to regular or inverted).
 
The example acts as follow :
In an infinite while loop 
  - Use the DMA2D to blend the two sources images to the LCD display frame buffer.  
  - If the foreground alpha inversion is disabled (set to DMA2D_REGULAR_ALPHA) :    
     “Display Blended Image: Foreground Alpha Inversion OFF”  
  - If the foreground alpha inversion is enabled (set to DMA2D_INVERTED_ALPHA) :    
     “Display Blended Image: Foreground Alpha Inversion ON”  
  - Change the alpha inversion setting, wait for 2 sec and go to the next loop.
  
User can see the result blending image with foreground alpha inversion enabled and disabled.

@Note The example shows how to use the DMA2D blending with alpha inversion set on the foreground layer.
      Nevertheless the same parameter can be applied on the background DMA2D input layer 
      or/and at the output level depending of the user application requirements.

STM32H7B3I-DK board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED2 is ON when the DMA2D transfer is complete.
 - LED3 toggles each 100ms when there is a DMA2D transfer error.
 - LED3 is ON when there is an error in LTDC transfer/Init process.
         
@Note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@Note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA (or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : CD AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case, it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series and STM32H7 Series

@Note  The header files of the images used in this example can be generated with 
       STemWin bitmap converter released with this package.
