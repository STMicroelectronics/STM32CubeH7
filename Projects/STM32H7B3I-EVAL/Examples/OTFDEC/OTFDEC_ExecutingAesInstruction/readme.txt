@par Example Description

This example shows how to use OTFDEC to decrypt and execute PI calculation algorithm stored in external NOR flash
using the embedded crypto IP standard AES-128 counter mode to encrypt the binary image
The USART1 is used to verify that decryption and executing instruction are done correctly.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H7B3xxQ Devices :
The CPU at 280MHz
The HCLK for CD Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , CD Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and SRD Domain AHB4  peripherals at 280MHz.
The APB clock dividers for CD Domain APB3 peripherals, CD Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and SRD Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 140MHz.


In this example a code computing PI value has been compiled to be executing from external NOR flash, the hex file has been converted to an array file in ospi1_code.c
This example begins with encrypting the code using the standard AES 128 in counter mode with the crypto HW IP. The encrypted code is flashed
in the external NOR flash memory, the OTFDEC region is configured depending of the parameters used to encrypt the code with the AES-128 counter mode,
the external NOR flash is configured in memory map mode and the user application jumps to the external memory and execute the encrypted code which is
decrypted on the fly thanks to the OTFDEC
The result of the PI computation is displayed on serial terminal via the UART1 interface

@note Some code parts can be executed in the ITCM-RAM (64 KB) which decrease critical task execution time, compared
      to code execution from Flash memory. This feature can be activated using '#pragma location = ".itcmram"' to be
      placed above function declaration, or using the toolchain GUI (file options) to execute a whole source file in
	  the ITCM-RAM.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
              In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
              Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
              Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
              Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32H7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H7B3xxQ devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32H7B3I-EVAL
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - STM32H7B3I-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that JP4 and JP23 are fitted on OCSPI1 Position.
    - Make sure that jumpers JP20 and JP21 are fitted.

    - Connect the board to an HyperTerminal PC application through USART1 via the STLINK V3 USB to UART connector CN9
      UART configured as follows:
      - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit) BE CAREFUL : Program 7 data bits + 1 parity bit in PC HyperTerminal
      - Stop Bit    = One Stop bit
      - Parity      = ODD parity
      - BaudRate    = 115200 baud
      - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
