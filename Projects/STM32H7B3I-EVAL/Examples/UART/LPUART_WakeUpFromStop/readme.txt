  | (follows a sequence of  |                     | (sends stimulus to wake |
  | RUN/STOP modes)         |                     |  up STM32 Board 1)      |
  |_________________________|                     |_________________________|


Board 1 enters STOP mode and is awoken by Board 2 which sends
the proper data to wake up the board 1 MCU.
When the proper wake-up event is recognized, the WUF interrupt is triggered which wakes
up board 1.
To confirm its wake up, board 1 sends a confirmation message to board 2 which
checks it is the expected message.
This cycle is repeated 4 times to verify 4 different events
1°) wake-up by RXNE flag rising
2°) wake-up by Start Bit detection
3°) wake-up by 7-bit long address match
4°) wake-up by 4-bit long address match

WARNING: as both boards do not behave the same way, "BOARD_IN_STOP_MODE"
compilation switch is defined in UART/LPUART_WakeUpFromStop/Src/main.c and must be
enabled at compilation time before loading the executable in board 1 (that which
is set in STOP mode).
The stimuli-transmitting board (board 2) needs to be loaded with an executable
software obtained with BOARD_IN_STOP_MODE disabled.

At the very beginning, board 1 LED1 is ON then is turned off.
This means that board 1 has entered STOP mode.
Parallely, board 2 LED1 is quickly blinking (100 ms period). The user has
just to wait for board 1 LED1 to be turned off then to press board 2 TAMPER push-button
to send the first wake-up stimulus to board 1.
This starts the test sequence and no more action is required from the user
(a single TAMPER push-button press is needed to start the full 4 wake-up events
test sequence).

Board 1 LED1 behavior as described below allows to follow the
test progress:

ON ____          _______          _______          _______          ____

Simultaneously, board 2 LED1 behavior shown below allows to follow the
test progress on the other side:

- If the test fails or if there is an initialization or transfer error, LED3 and LED1 are turned ON.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H7B3xxQ Devices :
The CPU at 280 MHz.
The HCLK for CD Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals, CD Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and SRD Domain AHB4 peripherals at 280 MHz.
The APB clock dividers for CD Domain APB3 peripherals, CD Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and SRD Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 280 MHz/2.

Additionally the HSI is enabled (in stm32h7xx_hal_msp.c) to demonstrate LPUART wake-up capabilities.
Each time board 1 is awoken, the system clock (SYSCLK) at 280 MHz is restored.


The LPUART is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 bits (8 data bits, no parity bit)
    - One Stop Bit
    - Parity none
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)


@note LPUART instance used and associated resources can be updated in "main.h"
file depending hardware configuration used.

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact that the
    Cortex-M7 core is no longer clocked during low power mode and so debugging
    features are not available.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : CD AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters (DMAs, DMA2D, LTDC, MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
              Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
              Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series and STM32H7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H7B3xxQ devices.

  - This example has been tested with a couple of STM32H7B3I-EVAL boards embedding a
    STM32H7B3xxQ device and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - STM32H7B3I-EVAL set-up
    - Connect a wire between 1st board PA.10 (pin 20 on CN5 (LPUART Tx)) and 2nd board (PA.09 pin 21 on CN5 (LPUART Rx))
    - Connect a wire between 1st board PA.09 (pin 21 on CN5 (LPUART Rx)) and 2nd board (PA.10 pin 20 on CN5 (LPUART Tx))
    - connect the GND of the 1st Board to the GND of the 2nd Board.
