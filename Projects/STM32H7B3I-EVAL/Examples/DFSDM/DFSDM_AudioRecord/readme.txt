@par Example Description

This example shows how to use the DFSDM HAL API to perform stereo audio recording.
For this audio record we will use two MP34DT01 digital microphones mounted on the
MB1299 module.

This projects is configured for STM32H7B3xxQ devices using STM32CubeH7 HAL and running on
STM32H7B3I-EVAL board from STMicroelectronics.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H7B3xxQ Devices :
The CPU at 280MHz
The HCLK for CD Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , CD Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and SRD Domain AHB4  peripherals at 280MHz.
The APB clock dividers for CD Domain APB3 peripherals, CD Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and SRD Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 140MHz.

MP34DT01 runs with a clock frequency from 1MHz to 3,25MHz.
This clock frequency has to be delivered by DFSDM. So first channel of DFSDM will be
configured to enable output clock generation, to choose audio clock as an output clock source,
and output clock divider will be set to generate an output clock in MP34DT01 frequency clock range.
Audio clock will be configured to 11.291MHz, so DFSDM output clock divider will be set to 4.

The digital audio outputs from the microphones are coded in PDM (Pulse Density Modulation) and
interlaced to use the same data wire connected to PC7. When CLK = 0, the left channel is sent
on PC7 and when CLK = 1, the right channel is sent on PC7.

PC7 can be configured as DFSDM_DATIN1 (DFSDM channel 3 external data input).
We will use DFSDM channel 3 to get left channel. DFSDM channel 3 will be configured to take
inputs from external serial inputs and from pins of channel 3. DFSDM channel 3 will also be
configured to operate in SPI mode with rising edge and with internal clock.
We will use also DFSDM channel 2 to get right channel. DFSDM channel 2 will be configured to take
inputs from external serial inputs and from pins of channel 3. DFSDM channel 2 will also be
configured to operate in SPI mode with falling edge and with internal clock.

DFSDM filter 0 will be used to perform left channels conversions.
We will use a SINC3 filter with oversampling at 64 and integrator oversampling at 1.
Oversampling is set to 64 in order to have an audio sample frequency at 44.1KHz (11.291MHz/(4*64)).
Regular conversions in fast mode will be performed in DMA mode on DFSDM filter 0 in order to fill
a buffer containing left audio samples at 44.1KHz.
DFSDM filter 1 will be used to perform right channels conversions.
We will use a SINC3 filter with oversampling at 64 and integrator oversampling at 1.
Oversampling is set to 64 in order to have an audio sample frequency at 44.1KHz (11.291MHz/(4*64)).
Regular conversions in fast mode and synchronized with DFSDM filter 0 regular conversions will be
performed in DMA mode on DFSDM filter 1 in order to fill a buffer containing right audio samples at 44.1KHz.

Playback of the recorded data will be performed on headset using HAL_SAI and CS42L51 audio codec.
A circular playback buffer will be filled as soon as recorded data are available.
When half left and right buffers will be filled, we put first parts of left and right channels data
on the first half of playback buffer.
When left and right buffers will be full filled, we put second parts of left and right channels data
on the second half of playback buffer.

STM32H7B3I-EVAL board's LEDs are used to monitor the example status:
  - LED3 toggle with a period of one second when  there is an error occurred.

The example includes also two functions used to configure MPU feature and to enable the CPU Cache,
respectively MPU_Config() and CPU_CACHE_Enable().
These functions are provided as template implementation that User may integrate in his application,
to enhance the performance in case of use of AXI interface with several masters.

@note Some code parts can be executed in the ITCM-RAM (64 KB) which decrease critical task execution time, compared
      to code execution from Flash memory. This feature can be activated using '#pragma location = ".itcmram"' to be
      placed above function declaration, or using the toolchain GUI (file options) to execute a whole source file in
	  the ITCM-RAM.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : CD AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
              In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
              Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
              Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
              Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32H7 Series”
