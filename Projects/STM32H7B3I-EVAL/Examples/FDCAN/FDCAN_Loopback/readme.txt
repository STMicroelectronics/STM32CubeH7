@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure the FDCAN to operate in loopback mode.

Boards: STM32H7B3I-EVAL  (embeding an STM32H7B3xxQ device)

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H7B3xxQ Devices:
 - The CPU at 280MHz
 - The HCLK for CD Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , CD Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and SRD Domain AHB4  peripherals at 280MHz.
 - The APB clock dividers for CD Domain APB3 peripherals, CD Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and SRD Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 140MHz.

Then:
 - FDCAN module is configured to operate in internal loopback mode.
 - FDCAN module is configured to receive:
    - messages with pre-defined standard ID to Rx Buffer 0
    - messages with pre-defined extended ID to Rx FIFO 1
 - FDCAN module is started.
 - The following messages are then sent:
    - one standard ID message matching Rx Buffer 0 filter
    - two extended ID messages matching Rx FIFO 1 filter

When Tamper push-button is pressed:
 - main program checks that the three messages are received as expected
 - if the result is OK, LED1 start blinking

If at any time of the process an error is encountered LED2 is turned ON.

@note Some code parts can be executed in the ITCM-RAM (64 KB) which decrease critical task execution time, compared
      to code execution from Flash memory. This feature can be activated using '#pragma location = ".itcmram"' to be
      placed above function declaration, or using the toolchain GUI (file options) to execute a whole source file in
	  the ITCM-RAM.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : CD AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
              Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
              Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H7B3xxQ devices.

  - This example has been tested with an STM32H7B3I-EVAL board embedding a
    STM32H7B3xxQ device and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
