@par Example Description

This projects is configured for STM32H7B3xxQ devices using STM32CubeH7 HAL and running on
STM32H7B3I-EVAL board from STMicroelectronics. It provides a description of how to use
the different BSP drivers.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H7B3xxQ Devices :
The CPU at 280MHz
The HCLK for CD Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , CD Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and SRD Domain AHB4  peripherals at 280MHz.
The APB clock dividers for CD Domain APB3 peripherals, CD Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and SRD Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 140MHz.

This example shows how to use the different functionalities of components
available on the board by switching between all tests using Tamper button.

The program starts by turning ON GREEN, YELLOW, ORANGE and RED LEDs.

 ** Push the Tamper button to start first Test.

 ** LCD TEST **
This example shows how to use the different LCD features to display string
with different fonts, to display different shapes and to draw a bitmap.

 ** TOUCHSCREEN DEMO1 **
Use touchscreen functionality to select or activate colored circle inside a rectangle.

 ** TOUCHSCREEN DEMO2 **
Use Multi-Touch functionality to draw 2 touch points, their positions will be
captured and displayed on the LCD.

 ** TOUCHSCREEN DEMO3 **
Use touchscreen interrupt mode detection functionality to draw a rectangle with
a random color.

 ** POTENTIOMETER TEST **
This example shows how to use ADC channel, linked to potentiometer RV1, to convert
voltage.
Make sure JP5 is plugged in position POTPA0_C.

 ** OCTO-SPI TEST **
Erase, Write and read Octo-SPI memory in:
- SPI or OPI modes
- STR or DTR transfer rate
- Direct or Memory Mapped read
@Note:
- Make sure JP4 and JP23 are in OCTOSPI position.

 ** AUDIO PLAY **
This example shows how to play an audio file using the DMA circular mode and
how to handle the buffer update.
Plug a headphone to CN18 to hear the sound
@Note:
1- To test SAI (default), make sure JP14, JP26, JP27, JP28 and JP34 are fitted
2- To test I2S:
   + Make sure JP7, JP8, JP9 and JP11 are in I2S position, JP18 is fitted and
     JP16 and JP39 are removed
   + Comment #define USE_SAI_INSTANCE in audio_play.c file

 ** AUDIO LOOPBACK SINGLE-BUFFERING **
This example shows how to record and play in loopback an audio stream using DFSDM
for recording and SAI for playing. The data are processed internaly within BSP
audio drivers and returned to user in PCM filtered format.
The DMA is configured in circular mode to play audio stream.

Plug a headphone to CN18 to hear the sound
@Note:
1- Make sure JP14, JP26, JP27, JP28 and JP34 are fitted
2- Make sure JP19 and JP35 are in DFSDM position

 ** AUDIO LOOPBACK MULTI-BUFFERING **
This example shows how to record and play in loopback an audio stream using DFSDM
for recording and SAI for playing. The data are processed at the application level
based on aquisation transfer completion status returned from BSP audio drivers.
The data are shifted to remove information data (the 8 LSB of each word) then a
saturation is applied to get final PCM filtered format.
The DMA is configured in circular mode to play audio stream.

Plug a headphone to CN18 to hear the sound
@Note:
1- Make sure JP14, JP26, JP27, JP28 and JP34 are fitted
2- Make sure JP19 and JP35 are in DFSDM position.

 ** AUDIO ANALOG LOOPBACK **
This example shows how to record and play in loopback an audio stream using SAI
for recording and for playing. Data are acquired from analog microphone and issued
to codec's INPUT LINE 1. The data are then sent on codec's headphone output to be
played using SAI.
The DMA is configured in circular mode to play audio stream.

Plug a microphone and a headphone to CN18 to hear the sound acquired from microphone.

@Note:
1- Make sure JP14, JP26, JP27, JP28 and JP34 are fitted

** CAMERA TEST **
This example shows how to use BSP drivers to test the camera features(resolution,
contrast, brighteness, zoom ...)

@Note:
1- Make sure JP1, JP6, JP7, JP17 and JP32 are DCMI position.
2- Make sure JP2 and JP35 are removed.

** SD POLLING TEST **
This example shows how to erase, write and read the SD1 card in polling mode and
also how to detect the presence of the card in IT mode.
- Make sure JP12 and JP15 are in SDIO1 position.

also how to detect the presence of the card in IT mode.

also how to detect the presence of the card in IT mode.

 ** EEPROM TEST **
This example show how to read and write data in EEPROM I2C M24LR64 connected on STM32H7B3I_EVAL 
Plug an I2C RF EEPROM memory (M24LR64) on CN24 connector

 ** NOR **
This example shows how to erase, write and read the NOR memory.

 ** SDRAM TEST **
This example shows how to erase, write and read the SDRAM memory.

 ** SRAM TEST **
This example shows how to erase, write and read the SRAM memory.
- Make sure JP2 and JP12 are in SRAM position.

@note Some code parts can be executed in the ITCM-RAM (64 KB) which decrease critical task execution time, compared
      to code execution from Flash memory. This feature can be activated using '#pragma location = ".itcmram"' to be
      placed above function declaration, or using the toolchain GUI (file options) to execute a whole source file in
	  the ITCM-RAM.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : CD AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case, it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series and STM32H7 Series"
