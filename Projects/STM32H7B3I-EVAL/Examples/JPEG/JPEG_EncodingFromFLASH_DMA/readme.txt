@par Example Description

This example demonstrates how to read an RGB image stored in the internal FLASH, encode it 
using the JPEG HW encoder in DMA mode and save it in SDCard.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H7B3XXQ Devices :
The CPU at 280 MHz.
The HCLK for CD Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals, CD Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and SRD Domain AHB4  peripherals at 280 MHz.
The APB clock dividers for CD  Domain APB3 peripherals, CD Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and SRD  Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 280 MHz/2.

The example performs the following actions :
  - Link the uSD disk I/O driver.
  - Register the file system object (mount) to the FatFs module for the uSD drive.
  - Create the JPEG file with write access.
  - Call the function "JPEG_Encode_DMA" to start encoding the jpg file with DMA (Non blocking method).
    the RGB input image name is automatically selected according to the selected RGB format as follow :
    - Image_RGB888 for RGB888 (#define JPEG_RGB_FORMAT      JPEG_RGB888)
    - Image_RGB565 for RGB565 (#define JPEG_RGB_FORMAT      JPEG_RGB565)
    - Image_ARGB8888 for ARGB8888 (#define JPEG_RGB_FORMAT      JPEG_ARGB8888)
    Function "JPEG_Encode_DMA" is implemented in a separate module encode_dma.c.
    This module is a wrapper on top of the JPEG HAL driver
  - Save encoded data in jpg file
  - Once the encoding ends, close the jpg file.
  - The LED1 is On if the test ends properly.
  - The LED2 is On in case of LTDC Init or µSD errors.

@note The jpeg HW encoder inputs are organized in YCbCr blocks.
      The jpeg utilities functions implemented in "jpeg_utils.c" file are used to convert the input RGB pixels
      to YCbCr blocks.
      The JPEG utilities files allowing to convert RGB pixels to YCbCr blocks are available under \Utilities\JPEG

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The compiler optimizations level could be set to High/Balanced giving a good tradeoff between the code size and the performance (decode time).


@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : CD AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
              Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
              Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series and STM32H7 Series”
