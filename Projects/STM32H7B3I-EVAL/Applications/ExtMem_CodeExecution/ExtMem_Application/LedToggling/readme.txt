@par Application Description
This application provides sample LED toogling program with execution from external memory.

This application toggle trun on the LED_RED for 1 second after boot. Then
toggle the LED_GREEN each 200ms for 20 times and finally reset the microcontroller.

This application provide different configuration with linker files which allows different eXecution schemas
  Supported configuration by STM32H7B3I-Eval:
    - XiP From OSPI, Data on Internal SRAM
    - XiP From OSPI, Data on External SRAM
    - XiP From OSPI, Data on External SDRAM
    - XiP From NOR, Data on Internal SRAM
    - XiP From NOR, Data on External SRAM
    - XiP From NOR, Data on External SDRAM
    - BootROM : Execution From External SDRAM , Data on Internal SRAM
    - BootROM : Execution From External SRAM , Data on Internal SRAM
@note In BootROM configuration , application code is initially stored on sdcard or SPI nor then loaded to the SDRAM or SRAM after boot.
@note Make sure that chosen configuration matches ExtMem_Boot configuration in memory.h file.

@note For the chosen configuration check the approriate JP positions 
- Make sure JP4 and JP23 are in OCTOSPI1 position.
- Make sure JP2 is in SRAM position.
- Make sure JP32 and JP35 are in NOR position 
- Make sure JP15 and JP12 are in SDIO1 position

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : CD AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters (DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case, it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series and STM32H7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H7B3IxxQ devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32H7B3I-Eval
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

  1. Select required configuration in memory.h in ExtMem_CodeExecution\ExtMem_Boot\Inc application.
  2. Program the internal Flash with the ExtMem_Boot (see below).
  3. Use corresponding project configuration for ExtMem_Application\LedToggling.
  4. Program the external memory with "ExtMem_Application\LedToggling" application (see below).
  5. Start debugging user application or reset for free running.

In order to load the ExtMem_Boot code :
   - Open your preferred toolchain :
      - Open the Project
      - Rebuild all files
      - Load project image

In order to load the ExtMem_Application\LedToggling to the external memory:
   - Open your preferred toolchain
      - Open the Project
      - Use project matching ExtMem_Boot selected configuration
      - Rebuild all files:
      - Run & debug the program:
      - For an XiP configuration (eXecute in Place from OSPI, FMC-NOR):
        - Using EWARM or MDK-ARM : Load project image from the IDE: Project->Debug
        - Using STM32CubeIDE you must do the following and in the debug configuration -> Debugger Tab :

            - In debug probe choose ST-LINK GDB server
            - check External Loader 
            - Press the Scan button
            - Select the correct external loader for your memory:
              + Select the OSPI external flash loader "MX25LM51245G_STM32H7B3I-EVAL" in case of XiP from OSPI and Press Debug
              + Select the FMC-NOR external flash loader "M29W128GL_STM32H7B3I-EVAL" in STM32CubeProgrammer tool in case of XiP from FMC-NOR
			    and load the application binary output file to the FMC-NOR memory at the address 0x60000000
		    - Run the example

      - For a BootROM configuration (BootROM externalSRAM/external SDRAM):
        - if BINARY_AREA is USE_SPI_NOR then use the STM32CubeProgarmmer tool, select OSPI external flash loader "MX25LM51245G_STM32H7B3I-EVAL"
          and load the project.bin (application binary output file) to the OSPI memory at the address 0x90000000
        - if BINARY_AREA is USE_SDCARD then copy the project.bin to a micro-SD to be plugged on CN28 and reset the board.
        - In order to debug the  ExtMem_Application\LedToggling, user shall attach the debugger, and perform a reset
