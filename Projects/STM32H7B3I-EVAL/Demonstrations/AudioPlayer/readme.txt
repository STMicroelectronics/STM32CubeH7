@par Audio Player Demonstration Overview

 The audio player application provides a complete audio solution based on the STM32H7B3xx and and the TouchGFX APIs.
 It delivers a high-quality music experience. It supports playing music in WAV and mp3 formats but may
 be extended to support other compressed formats such as WMA audio format.
 You can use the *.wav and *.mp3 audio provided under "Utilities/Media/Audio" or any other ones.

@par Audio Player Demonstration feature
  - Support playing music in WAV and MP3 formats.
  - Offer playing audio and the system in Low power mode(main domain in DSTOP2)
  - Display total and elapsed times
  - Support repeat all and Shuffle
  - Volume control
  - Support progress bar navigation (seek to set the audio at specific position)
  - Display all supported audio files available on media storage

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This demonstration runs on STM32H7B3xx devices.    
  - This demonstration has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32H7B3I-EVAL boards and can be easily 
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.
     
@par How to use it ? 

To load the demonstration, use STM32CubeProgrammer to program both internal Flash and external OSPI memory.

In order to program the demonstration you must do the following:
2- Open STM32CubeProgrammer, go to "External loaders" menu then check "MX25LM51245G_STM32H7B3I-EVAL" box
3- Connect the STM32H7B3I-EVAL board to PC with USB cable through CN21 and click on STM32CubeProgrammer "Connect" button
4- Use the generated hex file  with STM32CubeProgrammer to program both internal Flash and external OSPI memory:
   - From Erasing and programming Menu browse to select the hex file
     then click on start programming
   
   You can also use the script "program_hexfile.bat" (available within the binaries package) to directly program this hex file into 
   the STM32H7B3I-EVAL board.
   This script will invoke the STM32CubeProgrammer with the correct OSPI flasher (MX25LM51245G_STM32H7B3I-EVAL)
   
5- copy the audio files provided under "/Media/Audio" in a SD card storage at audio folder
6- Plug the Media storage in CN28 and make sure that JP12 and JP15 are in SDIO1 position.
-> The internal Flash and the external OSPI are now programmed and the demonstration is shown on the board.


The binary and Media demonstration files are available from the STM32H7B3I-EVAL page in the Binary Delivery section.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : CD AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters (DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case, it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series and STM32H7 Series"
