@par Application Description

 This application describes how to configure LCD touch screen and attribute 
 an action related to configured touch zone and how to save BMP picture in USB Disk.
 
 At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
 all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
 The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
 The CPU at 400MHz 
 The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
 The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.  

 After LCD and touch screen initialization, touchscreen calibration is requested
 for better accuracy for MB1046 only, then, menu is displayed on the screen. 
 
 The menu contains palette of colors, clear icon, save icon, different kinds 
 of draw sizes, the current selected size, selected color and working rectangle. 

 Select one of proposed colors and select the size of brush to draw 
 inside the working rectangle.
 
 Clear the working window by pressing the clear icon or/and save the picture 
 in USB Mass Stroage by pressing the save icon.

  - LED1 is on to indicate the end of saving operation and a message is displayed 
    on LCD to indicate the beginning and the end of the saving operation.
  - LED3 is ON when any error occurs.

Notes: 
  -   After save operation, the touch positions are not cleared from STMPE811 FIFO 
      and the next touch in any positions of the LCD screen leads second save 
      operation.
      This limitation is only relative to ampire 480x272 LCD device.
  -   USB and LTDC share same pll3 as clock source: USB uses PLL3Q as divider to get 48 Mhz 
      and LTDC used PLL3R as divider to get needed frequency.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"
