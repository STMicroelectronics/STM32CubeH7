@par Application Description

This application provides a description on how to use STM32Cube firmware with FatFs 
middleware component as a generic FAT file system module, in order to develop an
application exploiting FatFs offered features with RAM disk (SRAM) drive 
configuration. 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.
 
The application is based on writing and reading back a text file from a drive,
and it's performed using FatFs APIs to access the FAT volume as described
in the following steps:

 - Link the SRAM disk I/O driver;
 - Register the file system object (mount) to the FatFs module for the SRAM drive;
 - Create a FAT file system (format) on the SRAM drive;
 - Create and Open new text file object with write access;
 - Write data to the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Open text file object with read access;
 - Read back data from the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Check on read data from text file;
 - Unlink the SRAM disk I/O driver.

Notice that the application manages possible errors that might occur during the 
access to FAT volume, when using FatFs APIs.

It is possible to fine tune needed FatFs features by modifying defines values 
in FatFs configuration file “ffconf.h” available under the project includes 
directory, in a way to fit the application requirements. 
 
STM32 board's LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - the green led, LED1, is ON when the application runs successfully.
  - the red led, LED3, is ON when any error occurs. 

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"
