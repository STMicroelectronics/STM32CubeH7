@par Application Description 

This application is a part of the USB Host Library package using STM32Cube firmware. It describes how to use
USB host application based on the Human Interface Class (HID) on the STM32H7x devices.

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32H7x USB OTG Host peripheral to interact with an USB 
HID Device such as a Mouse or a Keyboard.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals and initialize the Flash interface.
The HAL initializes the TIM6 to generate an interrupt each 1ms, it will be used as time base for the HAL drivers.
This application uses FreeRTOS, the RTOS initializes the systick to generate an interrupt each 1ms. 
The systick is then used for FreeRTOS time base.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.

The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from PLL3.
In the High Speed (HS) mode the USB clock (60 MHz) is driven by the ULPI.

When the application is started, the connected HID device (Mouse/Keyboard) is detected in HID mode and 
gets initialized. This application is based on interacting with a HID device (Mouse/Keyboard).It creates a normal
priority thread, that executes a HID routine.

The STM32 MCU behaves as a HID Host, it enumerates the device and extracts VID, PID, 
manufacturer name, Serial number and product name information and displays it on The IO Terminal of IAR.

By default debug messages are displayed on the debugger IO terminal; to redirect the Library
messages on the LCD screen, lcd_log.c driver need to be added to the application sources.

@note
It is possible to fine tune needed USB Host features by modifying defines values in USBH configuration
file “usbh_conf.h” available under the project includes directory, in a way to fit the application
requirements, such as:
- Level of debug: USBH_DEBUG_LEVEL
                  0: No debug messages
                  1: Only User messages are shown
                  2: User and Error messages are shown
                  3: All messages and internal debug messages are shown
   
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
	  
@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set according to the OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.
	    
For more details about the STM32Cube USB Host library, please refer to UM1720  
"STM32Cube USB Host library".

@par USB Library Configuration

To select the appropriate USB Core to work with, user must add the following macro defines within the
compiler preprocessor (already done in the preconfigured projects provided with this application):
      - "USE_USB_HS" when using USB High Speed (HS) Core
      - "USE_USB_FS" when using USB Full Speed (FS) Core 
      
- @note In case of using an AZERTY keyboard, user should add "AZERTY_KEYBOARD" define to ensure correct 
displaying taped characters.

- @note Since this is an RTOS based application, built around FreeRTOS and CMSIS-OS wrapping layer common APIs,
the RTOS is enabled by setting, #define USBH_USE_OS      1

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"
