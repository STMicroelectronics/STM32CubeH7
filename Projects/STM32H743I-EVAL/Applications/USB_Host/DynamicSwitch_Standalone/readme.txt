@par Application Description 

This application is a part of the USB Host Library package using STM32Cube firmware. It describes how to use
dynamically switch, on the same port, between available USB host applications on the stm32h7xx devices.

The USBH_RegisterClass() API is provided by the USB Host Library to load the class driver. In this 
application MSC, HID and AUDIO classes are loaded and the user can start his application depending on the
connected device. 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz

The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from main PLL3.
In the High Speed (HS) mode the USB clock (60 MHz) is driven by the ULPI.

When the application is started, the connected USB device is detected in the appropriate mode 
(MSC/HID/AUDIO) and gets initialized. The STM32 MCU behaves as a (MSC/HID/AUDIO) Host, it enumerates the
device and extracts VID, PID, manufacturer name, Serial number and product name information and displays it 
on the LCD screen.

A menu is displayed depending on the connected device and the user can select any operation from the 
menu using the Joystick buttons.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

For more details about the STM32Cube USB Host library, please refer to UM1720  
"STM32Cube USB Host library".


@par USB Library Configuration

To select the appropriate USB Core to work with, user must add the following macro defines within the
compiler preprocessor (already done in the preconfigured projects provided with this application):
      - "USE_USB_HS" when using USB High Speed (HS) Core
      - "USE_USB_FS" when using USB Full Speed (FS) Core 

It is possible to fine tune needed USB Host features by modifying defines values in USBH configuration
file “usbh_conf.h” available under the project includes directory, in a way to fit the application
requirements, such as:
- Level of debug: USBH_DEBUG_LEVEL
                  0: No debug messages
                  1: Only User messages are shown
                  2: User and Error messages are shown
                  3: All messages and internal debug messages are shown
   By default debug messages are displayed on the debugger IO terminal; to redirect the Library
   messages on the LCD screen, lcd_log.c driver need to be added to the application sources.
 
- Number of supported classes: USBH_MAX_NUM_SUPPORTED_CLASS  

@Note  When running Audio demo, Tamper button should be pressed to stop the audio
       player and return to the main menu
       When running HID demo, In case of using an AZERTY keyboard, user should add
       "AZERTY_KEYBOARD" define to ensure correct displaying taped characters.


@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"
