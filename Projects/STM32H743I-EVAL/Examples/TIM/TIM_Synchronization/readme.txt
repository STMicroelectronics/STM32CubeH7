@par Example Description 

This example shows how to synchronize TIM1 and Timers (TIM3 and TIM4) in parallel mode.

Timers synchronisation in parallel mode:


                                                       ___________ 
                                                 ITR0 |  SLAVE 1  |
                                     _________________|    TIM3   |
   ___________                      |                 |___________|
  |   MASTER  |TRGO_Update          |                 
  |    TIM1   |---------------------|               
  |___________|                     |                  ___________ 
                                    |_________________|  SLAVE 2  |
                                                 ITR0 |    TIM4   |
                                                      |___________|
                         

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz

1/ TIM1 is configured as Master Timer:
   - PWM Mode is used
   - The TIM1 Update event is used as Trigger Output 
 
2/ TIM3 and TIM4 are slaves for TIM1,
   - PWM Mode is used
   - The ITR0(TIM1) is used as input trigger for both slaves
   - Gated mode is used, so starts and stops of slaves counters
     are controlled by the Master trigger output signal(update event).

The TIM1 counter clock is 200 MHz.

  The Master Timer TIM1 is running at:
  TIM1 frequency = TIM1 counter clock / (TIM1_Period + 1) = 781.250 KHz and
  a the duty cycle equal to: TIM1_CCR1/(TIM1_ARR + 1) = 50%

  The TIM3 is running at: 
  (TIM1 frequency)/ ((TIM3 period +1)* (TIM1_Repetition_Counter+1)) = 52.083 KHz and
  a duty cycle equal to TIM3_CCR1/(TIM3_ARR + 1) = 33.3%

  The TIM4 is running at:
  (TIM1 frequency)/ ((TIM4 period +1)* (Repetition_Counter+1)) = 78.125 KHz and
  a duty cycle equal to TIM4_CCR1/(TIM4_ARR + 1) = 50%


The PWM waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.
LED3 is ON when there are an error

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H743xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32H743I-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.      

  - STM32H743I-EVAL Set-up
   Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1 CH1 (PA.08)(CN7 PIN52)   
      - TIM3 CH1 (PC.06)(CN7 PIN 45)
      - TIM4 CH1 (PB.06)(CN7 PIN18)

@par How to use it ? 
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred tool chain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
