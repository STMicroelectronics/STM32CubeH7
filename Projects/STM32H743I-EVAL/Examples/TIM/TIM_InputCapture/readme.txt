@par Example Description 

  This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to measure the frequency of
  an external signal.
  
  At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
  all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
  The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
  The CPU at 400MHz 
  The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
  The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz

  The TIM1CLK frequency is set to 2*PCK2 = HCLK = SystemCoreClock/2 (Hz), the Prescaler is 0,
  so the TIM1 counter clock is SystemCoreClock/2 (Hz).
  SystemCoreClock is set to 400 MHz.

  TIM1 is configured in Input Capture Mode: the external signal is connected to 
  TIM1 Channel2 used as input pin.
  To measure the frequency we use the TIM1 CC2 interrupt request, so in the 
  TIM1_CC_IRQHandler routine, the frequency of the external signal is computed.

  The "uwFrequency" variable contains the external signal frequency:
  uwFrequency = TIM1 counter clock / uwDiffCapture (Hz),
  where "uwDiffCapture" is the difference between two consecutive TIM1 captures.


  The minimum frequency value to measure is TIM1 counter clock / CCR MAX
                                              = 200 MHz / 65535

  Due to TIM1_CC_IRQHandler processing time (around 5ns), the minimum
  frequency value to measure is around 4kHz.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H743xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32H743I-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  - Connect an external signal to TIM1 Channel2 (PE11 CN11 pin16).

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
