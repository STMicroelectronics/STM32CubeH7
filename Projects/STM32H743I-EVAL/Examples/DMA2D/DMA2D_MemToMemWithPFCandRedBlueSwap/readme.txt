@par Example Description

  This example provides a description of how to configure DMA2D peripheral in 
  Memory_to_Memory transfer mode with Pixel Format conversion and Red and Blue swap,
  and display the result on LCD.
  The source buffer in format RGB565 and size 320x240 located in Flash is copied 
  in Memory to Memory with PFC mode by the DMA2D to the SDRAM LCD frame buffer for display. 
  The DMA2D output offset and destination address are calculated in a way 
  to locate the image in the center of the LCD screen.

  At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
  all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
  The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
  The CPU at 400MHz 
  The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
  The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.
 
  In this basic example the goal is to explain the utility of the DMA2D field "RedBlueSwap" 
  in the case of Memory_to_Memory with PFC transfer mode.
  User can easily check the difference on the displayed image between "RedBlueSwap" set to DMA2D_RB_REGULAR and DMA2D_RB_SWAP:
  Red and Blue pixels components are mutually swapped.
    
  The example acts as follow :
  - first the LCD screen are initialized
  Then, in an infinite while loop
  - The DMA2D is configured to perform a transfer from input RGB565 image to the output ARGB8888 display frame buffer.
  - The parameter "RedBlueSwap" is changed for each iteration (from DMA2D_RB_REGULAR to DMA2D_RB_SWAP and vice versa).
  - then start the DMA2D and wait for the end of the transfer.
  - wait for 2 sec and go to the next loop.
  
  when the parameter "RedBlueSwap" is set to DMA2D_RB_REGULAR : display the message "Red and Blue Swap : OFF"
  when the parameter "RedBlueSwap" is set to DMA2D_RB_SWAP : display the message "Red and Blue Swap : ON "
  
 => Output offset is the number of pixel to be skipped after each transferred line
                      
 how to calculate the size of the transferred data ? 
 => selected color format gives the number of bits per pixel and we have 
    (RGB565 => 16bits/pixel) the number of pixel per line and the number of line, 
    therefore :
    
    data_size = (bits per pixel) X (pixel per line + output offset) X (number of line) 


STM32H743I-EVAL board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when the DMA2D transfer is complete.
 - LED2 is ON when there is a DMA2D transfer error.
 - LED3 is ON when there is an error in LTDC transfer/Init process.
         
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.


 @note  The header files of the images used in this example can be generated with 
        STemWin bitmap converter released with this package.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.

      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"
