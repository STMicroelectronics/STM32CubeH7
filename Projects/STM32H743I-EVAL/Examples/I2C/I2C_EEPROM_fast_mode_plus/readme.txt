      STM32H743I-EVAL

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.

The I2C peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_I2C_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_I2C_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed I2C resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
GPIO, DMA and NVIC). You may update this function to change I2C configuration.

The I2C/EEPROM communication is then initiated.
The HAL_I2C_Mem_Read_DMA() and the HAL_I2C_Mem_Write_DMA() functions allow respectively 
the reception of Data from EEPROM and the transmission of a predefined data 
buffer.

For this example the aTxBuffer is predefined and the aRxBuffer size is same as aTxBuffer.

In a first step the I2C writes the aTxBuffer by group of 4 bytes (RF EEPROM 
Page size) using HAL_I2C_Mem_Write_DMA() then read back the data through aRxBuffer
using HAL_I2C_Mem_Read_DMA(). 
The end of this two steps are monitored through the HAL_I2C_GetState() function
result.
Finally, aRxBuffer and aTxBuffer are compared through Buffercmp() in order to 
check buffers correctness.  

STM32 board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when the transmission process is complete.
 - LED2 is ON when the reception process is complete.
 - LED3 is ON when there is an error in transmission/reception process.  

@note I2Cx instance used and associated resources can be updated in "main.h"
       file depending hardware configuration used.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"
