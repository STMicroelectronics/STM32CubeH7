@par Example Description

  This example describes how to configure the LTDC peripheral to display two Layers  
  at the same time.
  The goal of this example is to explain how to blend two layers and how to display 
  an image with L8 (8bits per pixels indexed) as pixel format. 

  At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
  all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
  The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
  The CPU at 400MHz 
  The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
  The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.
 
  After LCD initialization, the LCD layer 1 and Layer 2 are configured as following :
  - Layer 1 is configured to display an image loaded from flash memory with direct
    color (RGB565) as pixel format and 320x240 (QVGA) size.
  - Layer 2 is configured to display an image loaded from flash memory with indirect
    color (L8) as pixel format and 320x240 (QVGA) size.
    To display an image with an indirect color as pixel format a color lookup table (CLUT) 
    is loaded, then every byte from image data (L8_320x240) is considered as 
    a position in color lookup table (CLUT).(see example below)  

  The blending is always active and the two layers can be blended following 
  the configured blending factors and the constant alpha.
  In this example the constant alpha for layer 2 is decreased to see the layer 1
  in the intersection zone.

  Example :
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |Image data   |  position   CLUT(RGB Value)  |   Alpha  | Output (ARGB value)|
  |-------------|------------------------------|----------|------------------- |
  |00 10 FF 25  |  0   -----> 0xFD10EA         | 0xFF     | 0xFFFD10EA         |
  |             |  .                           |          | 0xFF1548AD         |
  |             |  .                           |          | 0xFFAE6547         |
  |             |  .                           |          | 0xFFDA14EA         |
  |             |  .                           |          | .                  |
  |             |  16  -----> 0x1548AD         |          | .                  |
  |             |  .                           |          | .                  |
  |             |  .                           |          | .                  |
  |             |  37  -----> 0xDA14EA         |          | .                  |
  |             |  .                           |          |                    |
  |             |  .                           |          |                    |
  |             |  255 -----> 0xAE6547         |          |                    |
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------       

  The images change unlike their positions on LCD in an infinite loop.

STM32H743I Eval board's LED can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED3 is ON when there is an error in Init process.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"
