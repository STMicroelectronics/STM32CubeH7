@par Example Description 


How to use the CRYP peripheral to encrypt/decrypt data(Plaintext/Ciphertext) using AES
ECB, CBC and CTR algorithm.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H753xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.


The AES mode requires:
1. Plaintext/Ciphertext: which will be encrypted with several algorithm & keys.    
   CiphertextAESECB128,CiphertextAESCBC192 and CiphertextAESCTR256 : which will 
   be decrypted respectively with ECB algorithm & 128bits key, CBC algorithm &
   192bits key and CTR algorithm & 256 key. 

3. InitVector or the Initialization Vector used only for CBC and CTR.

4. Key: is the parameter which determines the Ciphertext. In this example several
   key size are used,  128 bits for ECB, 192 bits for CBC and 256 bits for CTR.

CRYP peripheral must be initialized once from the beginning, then for each 
operation of encryption/decryption, only configuration should be made if needed.
 
The AES-ECB encryption/decryption in polling mode provide :
1. Encryptedtext: which is the encryption result of Plaintext, it is compared 
   to CiphertextAESECB128.
2. Decryptedtext: which is the Decryption result of Ciphertext,it is compared
   to Plaintext.

The AES-CBC encryption/decryption in DMA mode provide :
1. Encryptedtext: which is the encryption result of Plaintext, it is compared
   to CiphertextAESCBC192.
2. Decryptedtext: which is the Decryption result of Ciphertext,it is compared 
   to Plaintext.

The AES-CTR encryption/decryption in interrupt mode provide:
1. Encryptedtext: which is the encryption result of Plaintext, it is compared
   to CiphertextAESCTR256.
2. Decryptedtext: which is the Decryption result of Ciphertext,it is compared
   to Plaintext.
   
STM32H743I-EVAL LEDs are used to monitor the encryption/decryption  status:
 - LED1(GREEN) is ON when encryption/decryption  are right.
 - LED3(RED) is ON when encryption or decryption are wrong.
 
@note No CPU Data Cache maintenance is performe in this example, you can adress to
      CRYP_AESModes_DMA example to see how to manage CPU Data Cache.
            
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"
