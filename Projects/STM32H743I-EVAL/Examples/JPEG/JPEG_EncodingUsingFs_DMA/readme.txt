@par Example Description

This example demonstrates how to read bmp file from SDCard memory using Fatfs, encode it 
using the JPEG HW encoder in DMA mode and save it in SDCard.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.

The example performs the following actions :
  - Link the uSD disk I/O driver.
  - Register the file system object (mount) to the FatFs module for the uSD drive.
  - Open the bmp file "image.bmp" in read access.
  - Create the JPEG file with write access.
  - Call the function "JPEG_Encode_DMA" to start encoding the jpg file with DMA (Non blocking method).
    Function "JPEG_Encode_DMA" is implemented in a separate module encode_dma.c.
    This module is a wrapper on top of the JPEG HAL driver
  - Save encoded data in jpg file
  - Once the encoding ends, close the bmp and jpg file.
  - The Green LED1 is On if the test ends properly.
  - The Red LED3 is On in case of error. 
    
@note To run this example , you can use a BMP “.bmp file from\Utilities\Media\Pictures\BMP_XXXxXXX
      or use your own bmp image. The input BMP file should be 24bpp (i.e pixels are RGB888 format).
      To double check that the input BMP file is compatible, right click on file, go to "Details"
      and check that "Bit depth" is "24".
      The BMP file width and height must verify the following requirement:
      - If encoding parameters YCbCr 4:2:0 then width and height must be multiple of 16 pixels.
      - For all other modes, width and height must be multiple of 8 pixels.
      The encoding parameters are set in the "main.h" (JPEG_COLOR_SPACE and JPEG_CHROMA_SAMPLING defines)   

@note The jpeg HW encoder inputs are organized in YCbCr blocks. 
      The jpeg utilities functions implemented in "jpeg_utils.c" file are used to convert the input RGB pixels
      to YCbCr blocks.
      The JPEG utilities files allowing to convert RGB pixels to YCbCr blocks are available under \Utilities\JPEG

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.


@note The compiler optimizations level could be set to High/Balanced giving a good tradeoff between the code size and the performance (decode time).

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H743xx device.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32H743I-EVAL  
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - STM32H743I-EVAL
  - Copy a bmp image to a uSD card (under the root)
      The image must have the following properties:
        - named as "image.bmp"
  - Connect the uSD Card to the Micro SD connector (CN13).
    
@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
