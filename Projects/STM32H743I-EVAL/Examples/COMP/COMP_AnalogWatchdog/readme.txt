@par Example Description 

This example shows how to make an analog watchdog using the COMP peripherals in window mode.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
- The CPU at 400MHz 
- The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
- The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz

  - The upper threshold is set to VREFINT (about 1.2V)
  - The lower threshold is set to VREFINT / 4 (about 0.3V)
      NB: For precise values of VREFINT & VREFINT/4, please refer to datasheet.
  - The input voltage is configured to be connected to pin PB.00
  
The MCU wakes up from Stop mode when the input voltage is above the higher threshold and under the lower threshold.

LEDs on STM32H743I-EVAL can be used to monitor the voltage level compared to comparators thresholds:

- LED3 blinks when input voltage is above the higher threshold.
- LED2 blinks if the input voltage is under the lower threshold.
- If the input voltage is within the thresholds, the MCU is set in STOP mode. LED2 and LED3 don't blink.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides 
      accurate delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. 
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than the 
      peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked. 
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set 
      to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32H743xx devices.
  - In this example, the clock is set to 400 MHz.

  - This example has been tested with STM32H743I-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32H743I-EVAL Set-up
    Use an external power supply and adjust supply voltage (above, within and below thresholds),
    and connect it on PB.00 (PIN29 CN6)
        
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
