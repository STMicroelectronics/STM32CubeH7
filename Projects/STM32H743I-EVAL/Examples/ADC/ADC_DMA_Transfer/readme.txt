@par Example Description 

This example describes how to configure and use the ADC to convert an external
analog input and get the result using a DMA transfer through the HAL API.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz

The ADC is configured to convert continuously ADC_CHANNEL_0, resolution is set to 16
bits right aligned, conversion is software-triggered.

DMA1_Stream1 is configured in Circular mode to transfer continuously
the content of ADC_DR (Data Register) to "aADCxConvertedData" variable which 
stores the conversion result.

User may watch variable array "aADCxConvertedData" and check that its value is modified
according to the voltage applied to PA.0_c, directly controlled by
the Eval Board potentiometer (RV1).

STM32 board LED can be used to monitor the conversion:
  - LED3 is ON when there is an error in initialization.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the �MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
����� If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then �the user has to:
����������� � - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
����������� � - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
�������       - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly�defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
�
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
������Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
������Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H743xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32H743I-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32H743I-EVAL Set-up
    Use an external power supply and adjust supply voltage and connect it on PA.0_c (CN6 pin16)

  - To monitor the conversion result, put the "aADCxConvertedData" variable in the debugger live watch.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
