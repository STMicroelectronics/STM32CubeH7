@par Example Description

This example describes an UART transmission (transmit/receive) between a board and 
an Hyperterminal PC application by using an interrupt.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz

Board: STM32H743I-EVAL
Tx Pin: PB.14
Rx Pin: PB.15

  |_STM32_Board_____________|

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 400 MHz for STM32H7xx Devices.

The UART peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_UART_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_UART_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed UART resources according to the used hardware.
You may update this function to change UART configuration.

The UART/Hyperterminal communication is then initiated.
The HAL_UART_Receive_IT() and the HAL_UART_Transmit_IT() functions allow respectively
the reception of Data from Hyperterminal and the transmission of a predefined data
buffer.

The Asynchronous communication aspect of the UART is clearly highlighted as the
data buffers transmission/reception to/from Hyperterminal are done simultaneously.

For this example the aTxStartMessage and aTxEndMessage is predefined and the aRxBuffer
size is limited to 10 data by the mean of the RXBUFFERSIZE define in the main.c file.

In a first step the received data will be stored in the aRxBuffer buffer and the
aTxStartMessage and aTxEndMessage buffer content will be displayed in the Hyperterminal
interface.
In a second step the received data in the RxBuffer buffer will be sent back to 
Hyperterminal and displayed.
The end of this two steps are monitored through the HAL_UART_GetState() function
result.

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when the transmission process is complete.
 - LED4 is ON when the reception process is complete.
 - LED3 is ON when there is an error in transmission/reception process.
 - LED3 toggles when there another error is detected.

The UART is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit)
    - One Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Reception and transmission are enabled in the time

@note USARTx/UARTx instance used and associated resources can be updated in "main.h"
      file depending hardware configuration used.

@note When the parity is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at the MSB
      position of the transmitted data.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H743xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32H743I-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32H743I-EVAL Set-up
      Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN2 (USART1) and PC serial port if you want to display data on the HyperTerminal.

@note Make sure that jumper JP7 is on TX position and JP8 is on RX position

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Data Length = 7 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud
    - Flow control: None

@par How to use it ?
