@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the SAI HAL API to play an audio file using the DMA 
circular mode and how to handle the buffer update.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
 - The CPU at 400MHz 
 - The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals 
   and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
 - The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals 
   and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz

      Plug a headphone to hear the sound  /!\ Take care of yours ears.
      Default volume is 20%.
      The audio file is played in loop
      @Note: Copy file 'audio.bin' (available in AudioFile) directly in the flash 
      at @0x08080000 using ST-Link utility
      The sound is output on Headset connector CN17 of  STM32H743I-EVAL.
      
In case of error, LED3 is on.

Once started, LED1 is toggling on STM32H743I-EVAL.

@note Note the DMA runs in circular buffer mode and never stops. If you break with 
      the debugger, the DMA hw will keep running and a noise will be heard.

@note This example does not use BSP_AUDIO so the MspInit is coded in the main.c.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H743xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32H743I-EVAL
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.      

  - STM32H743I-EVAL Set-up :
    - Plug a headphone on CN17 connector (Headset).

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
