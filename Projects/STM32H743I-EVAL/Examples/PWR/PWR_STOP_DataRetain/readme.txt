@par Example Description 
 
This example shows how to retain data in D3SRAM when the system enter STOP mode with:
  - D1 domain in Standby mode to guarantee low power consumption.
  - D2 Domain in Standby mode to guarantee low power consumption.
  - D3 Domain in Stop mode to maintain D3SRAM data.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
 - The CPU at 400MHz 
 - The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals 
   and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
 - The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals 
   and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz

In the associated software
  - The Low Speed Internal (LSI) clock is used as RTC clock source by default.
  - The EXTI_Line19 connected internally to the RTC Wakeup event is configured
    to generate an interrupt on rising edge each 5s.
  - The SysTick is programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms. 

After start-up the system writes a buffer of 16 KBytes in the D3SRAM then automatically enters the STOP mode after 3 Sec. 
The RTC is configured to generate an interrupt on rising edge about 5 Sec. afterwards.

Since the D1 domain is in Standby mode and the CPU is part of it, the program execution restarts in the same way as after
a software RESET after a wake-up from STOP mode.

After a wake-up from STOP mode the system checks the retained data in the D3SRAM. 
If no error occurred, the system cleans D1_Standby, D2_Standby and System_Stop flags then erases and writes 
data into the D3SRAM and returns in STOP mode.

Two leds LED1 and LED3 are used to monitor the system state as following:
 - LED3 ON: configuration failed or an error occurred (system will go to an infinite loop)
 - LED1 toggling: The system is in RUN mode
 - LED1 off : The system is in STOP mode

These steps are repeated in an infinite loop.
 
@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M7 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled.

@note Care must be taken when HAL_RCCEx_PeriphCLKConfig() is used to select 
      the RTC clock source; in this case the Backup domain will be reset in  
      order to modify the RTC Clock source, as consequence RTC registers (including 
      the backup registers) and RCC_CSR register are set to their reset values.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.      

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"
