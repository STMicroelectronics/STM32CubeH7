@par Application Description 

This application describes the software solution for substituting standalone EEPROM
by emulating the EEPROM mechanism using the on-chip Flash of STM32H743x devices.


Please refer to AN3969 of STM32F4xx devices for further details regarding this application to understand the principles about EEPROM Emulation.

@note The AN3969 contains specifications of STM32F4xx devices Flash memory.For STM32H743xx devices Flash memory specification, please refer
      to the STM32H7xx Reference Manual .

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.

The application requires two Flash memory sectors allocated to non-volatile data:
one that is initially erased, and offers byte-by-byte programmability; the other that is ready
to take over when the former sector needs to be garbage-collected. A header field that occupies
the first flash word (256-bits) of each sector indicates the sector status. Each of these sectors is
considered as a page.
The sectors used are as follows:
  -Flash Bank 2: Sector6, Sector7.


@note The firmware code is executed from Sector0 on Bank1 and the Read/Write
      operations on EEPROM are done on Bank2.
	  
NUCLEO-H743ZI 's LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED1 is ON when the application runs successfully.
  - LED2 is ON in case of error.
  - LED3 is Toggling when an operation of write and read is ongoing.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
      
@note The EEPROM algorithm includes flash erase operations, this could lead to data cache incoherencies 
      (as the erase operation is performed through a dedicated command).
      When the CPU Data Cache is enabled, user should ensure cache maintenance after erase operations.


@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"
