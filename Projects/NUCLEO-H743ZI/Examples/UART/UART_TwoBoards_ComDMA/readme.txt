Two identical boards are connected as shown on the picture above.
Board 1: transmitting then receiving board
Board 2: receiving then transmitting board

The user presses the User push-button on board 1.
Then, board 1 sends in DMA mode a message to board 2 that sends it back to 
board 1 in DMA mode as well.
Finally, board 1 and 2 compare the received message to that sent.
If the messages are the same, the test passes.


WARNING: as both boards do not behave the same way, "TRANSMITTER_BOARD" compilation
switch is defined in /Src/main.c and must be enabled
at compilation time before loading the executable in the board that first transmits
then receives.
The receiving then transmitting board needs to be loaded with an executable
software obtained with TRANSMITTER_BOARD disabled. 

NUCLEO-H743ZI board LEDs are used to monitor the transfer status:
- While board 1 is waiting for the user to press the User push-button, its LED1 is
  blinking rapidly (100 ms period).
- While board 2 is waiting for the message from board 1, its LED1 is emitting
  a couple of flashes every half-second.
- When the test passes, LED1 on both boards is turned on, otherwise the test has failed. 
- After the transmission/reception processes begin LED2 is turned on.
- Once the transmission/reception processes are completed LED2 is turned off.
- If there is an initialization or transfer error, LED_RED is turned on.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.


The UART is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 bits (8 data bits, no parity bit)
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Reception and transmission are enabled in the time

@note USARTx/UARTx instance used and associated resources can be updated in "main.h"
file depending hardware configuration used.

@note When the parity is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at the MSB
position of the transmitted data.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the �MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
����� If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then �the user has to:
����������� � - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
����������� � - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
�������       - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly�defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
�
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.

������Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32H743xx devices.    

  - This example has been tested with two NUCLEO-H743ZI boards embedding
    a STM32H743ZI device and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-H743ZI set-up
    - Connect a wire between 1st board PC6 pin (Uart Tx) and 2nd board PC7 pin (Uart Rx)
    - Connect a wire between 1st board PC7 pin (Uart Rx) and 2nd board PC6 pin (Uart Tx)
    - Connect 1st board GND to 2nd Board GND    

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
