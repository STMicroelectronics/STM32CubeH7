@par Example Description 

This example describes how to implement a low power timeout to wake-up the 
system using the LPTIMER, through the HAL LPTIM API.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz. 

The main() function configures the LPTIMER and goes in STOP mode.
In order to start the timer a first trigger is needed on (PG.14)(LPTIM_ETR).
Any successive trigger event on (PG.14) will reset the counter and the timer 
will restart. The timeout value corresponds to the compare value (32768).
If after the first trigger no other trigger occurs within the expected time frame, 
the MCU is woken-up by the compare match event and LED2 toggles.

In this example the LPTIM is clocked by the LSI 

  Timeout = (Compare + 1) / LPTIM_Clock
          = (32767 + 1) / LSI_Clock_Frequency

Once the system is woken up it remains in run mode. The led keeps toggling each time the timer expires.
		  
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.


@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H743xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-H743ZI
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.   
	
  - Connect an external trigger (ETR) to PG.14(pin61 CN12 connector ). 
    If the trigger is higher then 1Hz, the counter is regularly reset, the system stays in STOP mode.
    If the trigger is lower then 1Hz, the counter expires and the system is woken up.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred tool chain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
