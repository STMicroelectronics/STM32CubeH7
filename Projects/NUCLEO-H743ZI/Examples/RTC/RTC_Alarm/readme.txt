@par Example Description

How to configure and generate an RTC alarm.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
- The CPU at 400MHz
- The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
- The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz

The RTC peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_RTC_Init() function.
This latter is calling the HAL_RTC_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed RTC resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK,
PWR, RTC clock source and BackUp). You may update this function to change RTC configuration.

@note LSE oscillator clock is used as RTC clock source by default.
      The user can use also LSI as RTC clock source. The user uncomment the adequate
      line on the main.h file.
      @code
        #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSE
        /* #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSI */
      @endcode
       LSI oscillator clock must be calibrated first to deliver exactly a 32 kHz.
      LSE (when available on board) is delivered by a 32.768 kHz crystal.

HAL_RTC_SetDate() and HAL_RTC_SetTime() functions are called to initialize the
time and the date.
HAL_RTC_SetAlarm_IT() function is then called to initialize the Alarm feature with
interrupt mode.

In this example, the Time is set to 02:20:00 and the Alarm must be generated after
30 seconds on 02:20:30.

LED1 is turned ON when the RTC Alarm is generated correctly.
The current time is updated and displayed on the debugger in aShowTime variable.

In case of error, LED2 is toggled with a period of one second.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.


@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H743xx devices.
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-H743ZI
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
