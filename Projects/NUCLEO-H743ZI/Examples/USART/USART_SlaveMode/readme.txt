Two identical boards are connected as shown on the picture above.
Board 1: SPI Master board
Board 2: USART Slave board

In a first step, after the user press the User push-button, Master (SPI) starts
the communication by sending aTxBuffer and receiving aRxBuffer through
HAL_SPI_TransmitReceive(), at the same time Slave (USART) transmits aTxBuffer
and receives aRxBuffer through HAL_USART_TransmitReceive().
Finally, aRxBuffer and aTxBuffer are compared through Buffercmp() in order to
check buffers correctness.

WARNING: as both boards do not behave the same way, "SLAVE_BOARD" compilation
switch is defined in /Src/main.c and must be enabled at compilation time before
loading the executable in the board that first transmits then receives.
The receiving then transmitting board needs to be loaded with an executable
software obtained with SLAVE_BOARD disabled.

NUCLEO-H743ZI board LEDs are used to monitor the transfer status:
- While board 1 is waiting for the user to press the User push-button, its
  LED2 is blinking rapidly (100 ms period).
- After the transmission/reception processes begin LED2 is turned off.
- When the test passes, LED1 on both boards is turned on, otherwise the
  test has failed. 
- If there is an initialization or transfer error, LED3 is turned on.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.

@note USARTx/SPIx instances used and associated resources can be updated in
"main.h" file depending hardware configuration used.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than
      the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use
      HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to
      1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.

@note It is highly recommended to set the SPI parameter "MasterKeepIOState" to "SPI_MASTER_KEEP_IO_STATE_ENABLE"
      at init time. This configuration allows to avoid glitches on SPI lines especially the clock.
      Glitches that could lead to Master/Slave desynchronization. This config allows SPI Master to keep
      control on output state even if it is disabled.


@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32H743xx devices.    

  - This example has been tested with two NUCLEO-H743ZI boards embedding
    a STM32H743ZI device and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-H743ZI set-up
    - Connect Master board PA5 to Slave Board PD7
    - Connect Master board PA6 to Slave Board PD5
    - Connect Master board PA7 to Slave Board PD6
    - Connect Master board GND to Slave Board GND   

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory :
    - Uncomment "#define SLAVE_BOARD" and load the project in Slave Board
    - Comment "#define SLAVE_BOARD" and load the project in Master Board
  - Run the example
