@par Example Description

How to use a HW semaphore to synchronize 2 process.
In this example, HW semaphore (9) is used to synchronize 2 processes.
process 1 : Toggle Green Led (LED1) every 500 ms
process 2 : Toggle Blue  Led (LED2).

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.

First semaphore (9) is taken using HAL API HAL_HSEM_Take with process ID  set to "12". 
if the semaphore take is obtained Green LED (LED1) every 500 ms .
Once the total of 10 LED toggling (5 second)is done the semaphore is released using HAL API HAL_HSEM_Release.

Note that HAL_HSEM_Take use the 2-Step semaphore take method (refer to the HW Semaphore
description in the reference manual)


Pushing the "User" button will generate an EXTI interrupt. 
The corresponding EXTI callback will try to take the same semaphore (9) using 
HAL API HAL_HSEM_FastTake. 
If the semaphore has been released by first process , then the take is
obtained immediately and It will toggle Blue LED (LED2).

If not ,HW semaphore 9 not released yet by the first process , then the HAL_HSEM_FastTake API 
will return HAL_ERROR meaning that the semaphore is already taken by another process.
In this case the HAL API HAL_HSEM_ActivateNotification is called to enable receiving 
a notification once the semaphore will be released. 
Treatment will be postponed until the semaphore is released.
Once done, a HSEM interrupt is generated (semaphore 9), and HAL_HSEM_FreeCallback is asserted 
to toggle  Blue LED (LED2).

Note that the API HAL_HSEM_FastTake use the 1-Step semaphore take method (refer to the HW Semaphore
description in the reference manual) where the process ID is assumed to be zero.

As a result both processes will be synchronized, second process will toggle  Blue LED (LED2)
only when first process has ended toggle Green LED (LED1) 10 times.

Comment the define "USE_HW_SEMAPHORE" in the main.h to disable the HW semaphore
synchronization. In this case when the "User" button is pushed the EXTI
callback will toggle Blue LED (LED2) immediately (even if process 1 is toggling LED 1).
    
On NUCLEO-H743ZI:
    - EXTI15_10 is connected to User button

In this example, HCLK is configured at 400 MHz.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.


@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"
