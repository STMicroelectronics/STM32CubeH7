Algorithm implemented with preconditions:
CPU frequency: CM7 @ 550MHZ
Code : Flash Bank1
RW data : DTCM
CM7 L1-Cache ON 
Number of iterations : CM7 35000 
Compiler: IAR embedded workbench for ARM 7.80

@par Keywords

Demonstration, FreeRTOS, RTOS, Graphics, TouchGFX, Core Mark, EMMBC

This demonstration is provided as binary only (no source code)

This Demo MenuLauncher must be programmed into the oard first to allow running this sub-demo

In order program this sub-demo into the STM32H735G-DK board :
 - Open STM32CubeProgrammer and click on connect
 - Go to external loaders menu then select MX25LM51245G_STM32H735G-DK to program external OSPI memory
 - From Erasing and programming Menu browse to select the hex file from \Binary folder then click on start programming
  
 Or you can also use the script "program_hexfile.bat" (available within the binaries package) to directly program 
 this hex file into the STM32H735G-DK board.
 This script will invoke the STM32CubeProgrammer with the correct OSPI flasher (MX25LM51245G_STM32H735G-DK)
