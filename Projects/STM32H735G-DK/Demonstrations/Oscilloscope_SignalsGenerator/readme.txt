@par Demo Description


The STM32Cube Demonstration platform is built around the powerful analogs peripherals
and uses almost the whole STM32 capability to offer a large scope of usage based on
the STM32Cube HAL.

@par Demonstration Overview

The STM32H7 demonstration is running on the STM32H735G Discovery board.
The demonstration was created in purpose to highlight the analog features
of the STM32H735G chip.

To describe and to demonstrate those purposes , two RTOS tasks were configured to handle a
specific analog application:

 - The Task 1 : is used to handle the Signal Generator application (SG).
 - The Task 2 : is used to handle the Digital Signal Oscilloscope (DSO).

The Signal Generator application can be discarded when the user want to use only the
Digital Signal Oscilloscope with an external Signal Generator. 


++ Oscilloscope Application (Task 1 )
 + Signal conversion process
 --------------------------
 The oscilloscopes of today are mainly classified according to their maximum conversion
 frequency which depends basically on their powerful Analog to Digital Converters (ADC).
 STM32H7 include three ADCs, able to work separately or in interleaved mode depending on our
 purpose.
 In purpose to prouve their performaces to acheive the best oscilloscope results, four
 improuvments have been implemented with success:

      1. In purpose to reach up the maximum possible conversion frequency, three specific factors
      have been considered (Sampling time, Register of Successive Approximation (SAR) Time, ADC's Clock).

 In this exemple to reach up the maximum ADC conversion frequency, Sampling time was configured
 as minimum (1.5 ADC's clock) and ADC's Clock was configured as maximum possible (80MHz/2=40 MHz) throw
 an external clock source provided by PLL2. SAR Time was selected as 7.5 ADC's Clock refering
 to the conversion resolution which is fixed on 14 bits to ensure a better conversion quality.
  * Timing configuration:
  In this demonstration, the system clock is 520 MHz,ADC clock source is configured as external throw PLL2:
          * Sampling Time = 1.5 ADC Clock
          * Sar Time = 7.5 ADC Clock
          * ADC Clock = 40 MHz
 The minimum conversion time is (7.5+1.5) ADC period = 9 * 1/40MHz = 0.225 µS.
 The maximum conversion frequency is 1/0.225µS = 4.44 M Samples/s.

     2. In purpose to save the maximum possible of memory where samples are stocked specially for
     slow frequency. An algorithm based on Timer triggering was implemented to modify from the HMI
     the conversion frequency in the range of [500 Samples/S, 4 M Samples/S].

 TIM3, as a General-purpose 16 bits Timers was configured to make a hardware continous triggering to
 our ADC, the counting cycle from 0 to 65 536 finish with a hardware configured interrupt called
 update IT restarting the conversion cycle.
 The counting frequency, which depends on the two factors (Prescalar and Period) is the responsable
 to modify the conversion rate.

     3. In purpose to improuve the maximum conversion rate from 4 M Samples/S to 8 M Samples/S,
     an Interleaved conversion mode configured by ADC1 and ADC2 was made with success.

 ADC1 configured on the best possible performance (4 M Samlpes/S) is gone to convert the first part of
 the signal and trig the second slave ADC (ADC2) to finish the conversion. This mecanism which use a
 specific timing is descibed on ADC 8 M Samples/S conversion example.


 + Data manipulation process
 ---------------------------
 In order to minimize the power consumption of our DSO, Data manipulation from ADC's to the RAM was
 ensured by Direct Memory Acces (DMA). Two differents methods of data management are created depending
 on the conversion mode.
      1. Single Mode : Direct transfer data using a circular 16 bits DMA.
      2. Dual Mode   : Master 16 bits results are stocked in the 16 MSB bits of the 32 commun Data register CDR
                       and wait for the slave ADC to provide the other 16 bits. the moment when the register is
                       filled, the data are transferred using a circular 32 bits DMA mode.

 + Humain Machine Interface
 --------------------------
 A DSO need A graphical unit interface to display signals, A GUI made using Visual Studio with C# are created to
display continously signals coming from the MCU.


 + Communication between the GUI and the MCU
 -------------------------------------------
 In order the make a full duplex communication between GUI and MCU, UART communication protocol was made
 to transfer samples from the MCU to the GUI and receive from there the user command including the new configuration.

 + Signal Frequency detection
 -------------------------------------------
 In purpose to caracterise the externals signals displayed in the digital signal oscilloscope, A simple mecanism based
 on the time between samples information was made on the GUI to detect the frequency of the signal.

    - Signal Period = Number of samples per period * time between two successive samples.
    - Signal Frequency = 1 / Signal Period.

@note The configured Baude rate on the oscilloscope is 115200 bit/s.
@note Only signals with amplitude less than 3.3 V have to put to the input.

++ Signals Generator Application (Task 2 )
 This Task t uses the DAC capabilities  to generate different waves forms 
 with the possibilty to configure the frequency
 and the amplitude of the generated signal.

 + Signals Generations Configuration:
   A User graphical inaterface is used to control the application configuration
   and shows the current output status:
    - Signal Type buttoms: to select the type of output signal (DC,Square,Sinus,Triangle,Escalator or Noise).
    - Signal Frequency buttoms: to configure the frequency of output signal (5.000Khz -> 130.000Khz).
    - Signal Amplitude buttoms: to configure the amplitude of output signal (0.100 V -> 3.300 V).

 + Signals Generations Status:
    - Shows the graphic of  current output signal.
    - Shows the Frequency and the amplitude of  current output signal.


@note The STM32H735 devices can reach a maximum clock frequency of 520 MHz.
