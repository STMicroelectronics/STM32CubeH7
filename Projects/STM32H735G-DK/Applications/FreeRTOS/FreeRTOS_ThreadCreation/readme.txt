@par Application Description

How to implement thread creation using CMSIS RTOS API. 

This application creates two threads with the same priority, which execute in 
a periodic cycle of 15 seconds. 

In the first 5 seconds, the thread 1 toggles LED1 each 200 ms and the 
thread 2 toggles LED2 each 500 ms.
In the following 5 seconds, the thread 1 suspends itself and the thread 2
continue toggling LED2.
In the last 5 seconds, the thread 2 resumes execution of thread 1 then 
suspends itself, the thread 1 toggles the LED1 each 500 ms.    

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR.
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than
      the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority()
      function.
 
@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set accordingly to the 
      OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.
