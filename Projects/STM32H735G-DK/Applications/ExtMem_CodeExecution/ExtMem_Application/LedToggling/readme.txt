@par Application Description

How to configure and use GPIOs through the HAL API.
This projects is configured for STM32H735xx devices using STM32CubeH7 HAL and running on
STM32H735G-DK board from STMicroelectronics.

This example provide different configuration with linker files which allows different eXecution schemas
Supported configuration by STM32H735-DISCO:
  - XiP From OSPI, Data on Internal SRAM
  - XiP From OSPI, Data on External OPSI RAM
  - BootROM : Execution From External OSPI RAM , Data on Internal SRAM
  
PC3 IO (configured in output pushpull mode) toggles in a forever loop.
On STM32H735-DISCO board this IO is connected to LED1.

The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H735xx Devices :
The CPU at 520 MHz
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI peripherals, D2 Domain AHB peripherals and D3 Domain AHB  peripherals at 260 MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 130 MHz.

The application includes also CPU_CACHE_Enable() to enable the CPU Cache. This function is provided to enhance the performance in case of use of AXI interface with several masters.

@note Some code parts can be executed in the ITCM-RAM (64 KB up to 256kB) which decreases critical task execution time, compared
      to code execution from Flash memory. This feature can be activated using '#pragma location = ".itcmram"' to be
      placed above function declaration, or using the toolchain GUI (file options) to execute a whole source file in
      the ITCM-RAM.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This Application runs on STM32H735xx devices.

  - This Application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32H735G-DK
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

  1. Select required configuration in memory.h in ExtMem_CodeExecution\ExtMem_Boot\Inc.
     The default configuration is: 
     - DATA_AREA set to USE_INTERNAL_SRAM
     - CODE_AREA set to USE_OSPI
  2. Program the internal Flash with the ExtMem_Boot (see below).
  3. Program the external memory with this application (see below).
  4. Start debugging user application or reset for free running.

In order to load the ExtMem_Boot code :
   - Open your preferred toolchain :
      - Open the Project
      - Rebuild all files
      - Load project image

In order to load the application to the external memory:
   - Open your preferred toolchain
      - Open the Project
      - Use project matching ExtMem_Boot selected configuration
      - Rebuild all files:
      - Run & debug the program:
      - For an XiP configuration (eXecute in Place from OSPI):
          - Using EWARM or MDK-ARM : Load project image from the IDE: Project->Debug
          - Using STM32CubeIDE :
            - Open the STM32CubeProgrammer tool
            - Select the OSPI external flash loader "MX25LM51245G_STM32H735G-DK" in case of XiP from OSPI
            - From Erasing & Programming menu, browse and open the output binary file relative to your application
            - Load the file into the external OSPI flash using "Start Programming" at the address APPLICATION_ADDRESS (0x90000000)

      - For a BootROM configuration (BootROM external OSPI RAM):
        - If BINARY_AREA is USE_SPI_NOR then use the STM32CubeProgarmmer tool, select OSPI external flash loader "MX25LM51245G_STM32H735G-DK"
          and load the Project.bin (application binary output file) to the OSPI memory at the address 0x90000000
        - If BINARY_AREA is USE_SDMMC then Copy-Paste the Project.bin (application binary output file) to the µSD card.
        - In order to debug the  external memory application, user shall attach the debugger, and perform a reset
