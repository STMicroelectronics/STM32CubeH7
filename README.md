# STM32CubeH7 MCU Firmware Package

**STM32Cube** is an STMicroelectronics original initiative to ease the developers life by reducing efforts, time and cost.

**STM32Cube** covers the overall STM32 products portfolio. It includes a comprehensive embedded software platform (this repo), delivered for each series (such as the STM32CubeH7 for the STM32H7 series).
   * The CMSIS modules (core and device) corresponding to the ARM-tm core implemented in this STM32 product.
   * The STM32 HAL-LL drivers : an abstraction drivers layer, the API ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 portfolio.
   * The BSP Drivers of each evaluation or demonstration board provided by this STM32 series.
   * A consistent set of middlewares components such as RTOS, USB, FatFS, LwIP, Graphics...
   * A full set of software projects (basic examples, applications or demonstrations) for each board provided by this STM32 series.

The **STM32CubeH7 MCU Package** projects are directly running on the STM32H7 series boards. You can find in each Projects/*Board name* directories a set of software projects (Applications/Demonstration/Examples).

In this FW Package, the modules **Middlewares/ST/TouchGFX**, **Middlewares/ST/STemWin**, and **Middlewares/ST/STM32_Audio** are not directly accessible. They must be downloaded from a ST server, the respective URL are available in a readme.txt file inside each module.
